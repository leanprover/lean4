# Self-Reflection Command

Review the current conversation and identify areas where you struggled, particularly with:
- Tool usage
- Repository layout and conventions
- Understanding expected workflows
- Interpreting test results or diagnostics

For each struggle identified:
1. Explain what happened and why it was problematic
2. Propose specific, concise additions to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` that would prevent this issue in future conversations

Present your findings and ask the user if they'd like you to add the suggested improvements to CLAUDE.md.

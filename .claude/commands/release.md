# Release Management Command

Execute the release process for a given version by running the release checklist and following its instructions.

## Before Starting

**IMPORTANT**: Before beginning the release process, read the in-file documentation:
- Read `script/release_checklist.py` for what the checklist script does
- Read `script/release_steps.py` for what the release steps script does

These comments explain the scripts' behavior, which repositories get special handling, and how errors are handled.

## Arguments
- `version`: The version to release (e.g., v4.24.0)

## Process

1. Run `script/release_checklist.py {version}` to check the current status
2. **CRITICAL: If preliminary lean4 checks fail, STOP immediately and alert the user**
   - Check for: release branch exists, CMake version correct, tag exists, release page exists, release notes exist
   - **IMPORTANT**: The release page is created AUTOMATICALLY by CI after pushing the tag - DO NOT create it manually
   - Do NOT create any PRs or proceed with repository updates if these checks fail
3. Create a todo list tracking all repositories that need updates
4. **CRITICAL RULE: You can ONLY run `release_steps.py` for a repository if `release_checklist.py` explicitly says to do so**
   - The checklist output will say "Run `script/release_steps.py {version} {repo_name}` to create it"
   - If a repository shows "ðŸŸ¡ Dependencies not ready", you CANNOT create a PR for it yet
   - You MUST rerun `release_checklist.py` before attempting to create PRs for any new repositories
5. For each repository that the checklist says needs updating:
   - Run `script/release_steps.py {version} {repo_name}` to create the PR
   - Mark it complete when the PR is created
6. After creating PRs, notify the user which PRs need review and merging
7. **MANDATORY: Rerun `release_checklist.py` to check current status**
   - Do this after creating each batch of PRs
   - Do this after the user reports PRs have been merged
   - NEVER assume a repository is ready without checking the checklist output
8. As PRs are merged and tagged, dependent repositories will become ready
9. Continue the cycle: run checklist â†’ create PRs for ready repos â†’ wait for merges â†’ repeat
10. Continue until all repositories are updated and the release is complete

## Important Notes

- The `release_steps.py` script is idempotent - it's safe to rerun
- The `release_checklist.py` script is idempotent - it's safe to rerun
- Some repositories depend on others (e.g., mathlib4 depends on batteries, aesop, etc.)
- Wait for user to merge PRs before dependent repos can be updated
- Alert user if anything unusual or scary happens
- Use appropriate timeouts for long-running builds (verso can take 10+ minutes)
- ProofWidgets4 uses semantic versioning (v0.0.X) - it's okay to create and push the next sequential tag yourself when needed for a release

## PR Status Reporting

Every time you run `release_checklist.py`, you MUST:
1. Parse the output to identify ALL open PRs mentioned (lines with "âœ… PR with title ... exists")
2. Provide a summary to the user listing ALL open PRs that need review
3. Group them by status:
   - PRs for repositories that are blocked by dependencies (show these but note they're blocked)
   - PRs for repositories that are ready to merge (highlight these)
4. Format the summary clearly with PR numbers and URLs

This summary should be provided EVERY time you run the checklist, not just after creating new PRs.
The user needs to see the complete picture of what's waiting for review.

## Error Handling

**CRITICAL**: If something goes wrong or a command fails:
- **DO NOT** try to manually reproduce the failing steps yourself
- **DO NOT** try to fix things by running git commands or other manual operations
- Both scripts are idempotent and designed to handle partial completion gracefully
- If a script continues to fail after retrying, report the error to the user and wait for instructions

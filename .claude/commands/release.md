# Release Management Command

Execute the release process for a given version by running the release checklist and following its instructions.

## Before Starting

**IMPORTANT**: Before beginning the release process, read the in-file documentation:
- Read `script/release_checklist.py` for what the checklist script does
- Read `script/release_steps.py` for what the release steps script does

These comments explain the scripts' behavior, which repositories get special handling, and how errors are handled.

## Arguments
- `version`: The version to release (e.g., v4.24.0)

## Process

1. Run `script/release_checklist.py {version}` to check the current status
2. Create a todo list tracking all repositories that need updates
3. For each repository that needs updating:
   - Run `script/release_steps.py {version} {repo_name}` to create the PR
   - Mark it complete when the PR is created
4. After creating PRs, notify the user which PRs need review and merging
5. Continuously rerun `script/release_checklist.py {version}` to check progress
6. As PRs are merged, dependent repositories will become ready - create PRs for those as well
7. Continue until all repositories are updated and the release is complete

## Important Notes

- The `release_steps.py` script is idempotent - it's safe to rerun
- The `release_checklist.py` script is idempotent - it's safe to rerun
- Some repositories depend on others (e.g., mathlib4 depends on batteries, aesop, etc.)
- Wait for user to merge PRs before dependent repos can be updated
- Alert user if anything unusual or scary happens
- Use appropriate timeouts for long-running builds (verso can take 10+ minutes)
- ProofWidgets4 uses semantic versioning (v0.0.X) - it's okay to create and push the next sequential tag yourself when needed for a release

## PR Status Reporting

Every time you run `release_checklist.py`, you MUST:
1. Parse the output to identify ALL open PRs mentioned (lines with "âœ… PR with title ... exists")
2. Provide a summary to the user listing ALL open PRs that need review
3. Group them by status:
   - PRs for repositories that are blocked by dependencies (show these but note they're blocked)
   - PRs for repositories that are ready to merge (highlight these)
4. Format the summary clearly with PR numbers and URLs

This summary should be provided EVERY time you run the checklist, not just after creating new PRs.
The user needs to see the complete picture of what's waiting for review.

## Error Handling

**CRITICAL**: If something goes wrong or a command fails:
- **DO NOT** try to manually reproduce the failing steps yourself
- **DO NOT** try to fix things by running git commands or other manual operations
- Both scripts are idempotent and designed to handle partial completion gracefully
- If a script continues to fail after retrying, report the error to the user and wait for instructions

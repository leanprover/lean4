* Include the link to your `RFC` or `bug` issue in the description.
* If the issue does not already have approval from a developer, submit the PR as draft.
* The PR title/description will become the commit message. Keep it up-to-date as the PR evolves.
* If you rebase your PR onto `nightly-with-mathlib` then CI will test Mathlib against your PR.
* You can manage the `awaiting-review`, `awaiting-author`, and `WIP` labels yourself, by writing a comment containing one of these labels on its own line.
* Remove this section, up to and including the `---` before submitting.

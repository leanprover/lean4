# Push a release to the lean4-pr-releases repository, whenever someone pushes to a PR branch.

# This needs to run with the `secrets.PR_RELEASES_TOKEN` token available,
# but PR branches will generally come from forks,
# so it is not possible to run this using the `pull_request` or `pull_request_target` workflows.
# Instead we use `workflow_run`, which essentially allows us to escalate privileges
# (but only runs the CI as described in the `master` branch, not in the PR branch).

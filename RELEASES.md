# Lean 4 releases

We intend to provide regular "minor version" releases of the Lean language at approximately monthly intervals.
There is not yet a strong guarantee of backwards compatibility between versions,
only an expectation that breaking changes will be documented in the release notes.

[Release notes](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/releases/#release-notes) are available in the Lean language reference.

Release notes for the current release candidate are available on the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/releases) page.

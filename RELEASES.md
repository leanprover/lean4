# Lean 4 releases

We intend to provide regular "minor version" releases of the Lean language at approximately monthly intervals.
There is not yet a strong guarantee of backwards compatibility between versions,
only an expectation that breaking changes will be documented in the release notes.

The folder [releases/](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/tree/master/releases)
contains work-in-progress notes for the upcoming release, as well as previous stable releases.

Please check the [releases](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/releases) page for the current status
of each version.

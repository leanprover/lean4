# Developer Documentation and Examples

This directory contains documentation that describes how to work on
Lean itself, as well as examples that are included in documentation
that's hosted on the Lean website.  The `make` directory contains
information on building Lean, and the `dev` directory describes how to
work on Lean.

The [documentation section](https://lean-lang.org/documentation) has
links to documentation that describes how to use Lean itself.

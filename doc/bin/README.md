Lean binary distribution
------------------------

The binary distribution package contains:

- Lean executable (located in the sub-directory bin)
- Standard library (located in the sub-directory lib/lean/library)

Assuming you are in the same directory this file is located,
the following command executes a simple set of examples

% bin/lean examples/ex.lean

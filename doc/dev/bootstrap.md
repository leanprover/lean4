
# Lean Build Bootstrapping

Since version 4, Lean is a partially bootstrapped program: most parts of the
frontend and compiler are written in Lean itself and thus need to be built before
building Lean itself - which is needed to again build those parts. This cycle is
broken by using pre-built C files checked into the repository (which ultimately
go back to a point where the Lean compiler was not written in Lean) in place of
these Lean inputs and then compiling everything in multiple stages up to a fixed
point. The build directory is organized in these stages:

```bash
stage0/
  # Bootstrap binary built from stage0/src/.
  # We do not use any other files from this directory in further stages.
  bin/lean
stage1/
  include/
    config.h  # config variables used to build `lean` such as use allocator
    runtime/lean.h  # runtime headers, used by extracted C code, uses `config.h`
  share/lean/
    Makefile  # used by `leanmake`
  lib/
    lean/**/*.olean  # the Lean library (incl. the compiler) compiled by the previous stage's `lean`
    temp/**/*.{c,o}  # the library extracted to C and compiled by `leanc`
    libInit.a libStd.a libLean.a  # static libraries of the Lean library
    libleancpp.a  # a static library of the C++ sources of Lean
  bin/
    lean  # the Lean compiler & server linked together from the above libraries
    leanc  # a wrapper around a C compiler supplying search paths etc
    leanmake  # a wrapper around `make` supplying the Makefile above
stage2/...
stage3/...
```

Stage 0 can be viewed as a blackbox since it does not depend on any local
changes and is equivalent to downloading a bootstrapping binary as done in other
compilers. The build for any other stage starts by building the runtime and
standard library from `src/`, using the `lean` binary from the previous stage in
the latter case, which are then assembled into a new `bin/lean` binary.

Each stage can be built by calling `make stageN` in the root build folder.
Running just `make` will default to stage 1, which is usually sufficient for
testing changes on the test suite or other files outside of the stdlib. However,
it might happen that the stage 1 compiler is not able to load its own stdlib,
e.g. when changing the .olean format: the stage 1 stdlib will use the format
generated by the stage 0 compiler, but the stage 1 compiler will expect the new
format. In this case, we should continue with building and testing stage 2
instead, which will both build and expect the new format. Note that this is only
possible because when building a stage's stdlib, we use the previous compiler
but never load the previous stdlib (since everything is `prelude`). We can also
use stage 2 to test changes in the compiler or other "meta" parts, i.e. changes
that affect the produced (.olean or .c) code, on the stdlib and compiler itself.
We are not aware of any "meta-meta" parts that influence more than two stages of
compilation, so stage 3 should always be identical to stage 2 and only exists as
a sanity check.

In summary, doing a standard build via `make` involves these steps:

1. compile the `stage0/src` archived sources into `stage0/bin/lean`
1. use it to compile the current library (*including* your changes) into `stage1/lib`
1. link that and the current C++ code from `src/` into `stage1/bin/lean`

You now have a Lean binary and library that include your changes, though their
own compilation was not influenced by them, that you can use to test your
changes on test programs whose compilation *will* be influenced by the changes.

Finally, when we want to use new language features in the library, we need to
update the stage 0 compiler, which can be done via `make -C stageN update-stage0`.
`make update-stage0` without `-C` defaults to stage1.

## Further Bootstrapping Complications

As written above, changes in meta code in the current stage usually will only
affect later stages. This is an issue in two specific cases.

* For *non-builtin* meta code such as `notation`s or `macro`s in
  `Notation.lean`, we expect changes to affect the current file and all later
  files of the same stage immediately, just like outside the stdlib. To ensure
  this, we need to build the stage using `-Dinterpreter.prefer_native=false` -
  otherwise, when executing a macro, the interpreter would notice that there is
  already a native symbol available for this function and run it instead of the
  new IR, but the symbol is from the previous stage!

  To make matters more complicated, while `false` is a reasonable default
  incurring only minor overhead (`ParserDescr`s and simple macros are cheap to
  interpret), there are situations where we *need* to set the option to `true`:
  when the interpreter is executed from the native code of the previous stage,
  the type of the value it computes must be identical to/ABI-compatible with the
  type in the previous stage. For example, if we add a new parameter to `Macro`
  or reorder constructors in `ParserDescr`, building the stage with the
  interpreter will likely fail. Thus we need to set `interpreter.prefer_native`
  to `true` in such cases to "freeze" meta code at their versions in the
  previous stage; no new meta code should be introduced in this stage. Any
  further stages (e.g. after an `update-stage0`) will then need to be compiled
  with the flag set to `false` again since they will expect the new signature.

  For an example, see https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/da4c46370d85add64ef7ca5e7cc4638b62823fbb.

* For the special case of *quotations*, it is desirable to have changes in
  built-in parsers affect them immediately: when the changes in the parser
  become active in the next stage, macros implemented via quotations should
  generate syntax trees compatible with the new parser, and quotation patterns
  in macro and elaborators should be able to match syntax created by the new
  parser and macros. Since quotations capture the syntax tree structure during
  execution of the current stage and turn it into code for the next stage, we
  need to run the current stage's built-in parsers in quotation via the
  interpreter for this to work. Caveats:
  * Since interpreting full parsers is not nearly as cheap and we rarely change
    built-in syntax, this needs to be opted in using `-Dinternal.parseQuotWithCurrentStage=true`.
  * The parser needs to be reachable via an `import` statement, otherwise the
    version of the previous stage will silently be used.
  * Only the parser code (`Parser.fn`) is affected; all metadata such as leading
    tokens is taken from the previous stage.

  For an example, see https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/f9dcbbddc48ccab22c7674ba20c5f409823b4cc1#diff-371387aed38bb02bf7761084fd9460e4168ae16d1ffe5de041b47d3ad2d22422
  (from before the flag defaulted to `false`).

To modify either of these flags both for building and editing the stdlib, adjust
the code in `stage0/src/stdlib_flags.h`. The flags will automatically be reset
on the next `update-stage0` when the file is overwritten with the original
version in `src/`.

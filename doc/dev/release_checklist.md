# Releasing a stable version

This checklist walks you through releasing a stable version.
See below for the checklist for release candidates.

We'll use `v4.6.0` as the intended release version as a running example.

- One week before the planned release, ensure that someone has written the first draft of the release blog post
- `git checkout releases/v4.6.0`
  (This branch should already exist, from the release candidates.)
- `git pull`
- In `src/CMakeLists.txt`, verify you see
  - `set(LEAN_VERSION_MINOR 6)` (for whichever `6` is appropriate)
  - `set(LEAN_VERSION_IS_RELEASE 1)`
  - (both of these should already be in place from the release candidates)
- It is possible that the `v4.6.0` section of `RELEASES.md` is out of sync between
  `releases/v4.6.0` and `master`. This should be reconciled:
  - Run `git diff master RELEASES.md`.
  - You should expect to see additons on `master` in the `v4.7.0-rc1` section; ignore these.
    (i.e. the new release notes for the upcoming release candidate).
  - Reconcile discrepancies in the `v4.6.0` section,
    usually via copy and paste and a commit to `releases/v4.6.0`.
- `git tag v4.6.0`
- `git push $REMOTE v4.6.0`, where `$REMOTE` is the upstream Lean repository (e.g., `origin`, `upstream`)
- Now wait, while CI runs.
  - You can monitor this at `https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/actions/workflows/ci.yml`,
    looking for the `v4.6.0` tag.
  - This step can take up to an hour.
  - If you are intending to cut the next release candidate on the same day,
    you may want to start on the release candidate checklist now.
- Go to https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/releases and verify that the `v4.6.0` release appears.
  - Edit the release notes on Github to select the "Set as the latest release".
  - Copy and paste the Github release notes from the previous releases candidate for this version
    (e.g. `v4.6.0-rc1`), and quickly sanity check.
- Next, we will move a curated list of downstream repos to the latest stable release.
  - For each of the repositories listed below:
    - Make a PR to `master`/`main` changing the toolchain to `v4.6.0`
      - Update the toolchain file
      - In the Lakefile, if there are dependencies on specific version tags of dependencies that you've already pushed as part of this process, update them to the new tag.
        If they depend on `main` or `master`, don't change this; you've just updated the dependency, so it will work and be saved in the manifest
      - Run `lake update`
      - The PR title should be "chore: bump toolchain to v4.6.0".
    - Merge the PR once CI completes.
    - Create the tag `v4.6.0` from `master`/`main` and push it.
    - Merge the tag `v4.6.0` into the `stable` branch and push it.
  - We do this for the repositories:
    - [lean4checker](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4checker)
      - No dependencies
      - Toolchain bump PR
      - Create and push the tag
      - Merge the tag into `stable`
    - [Batteries](https://github.com/leanprover-community/batteries)
      - No dependencies
      - Toolchain bump PR
      - Create and push the tag
      - Merge the tag into `stable`
    - [ProofWidgets4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/ProofWidgets4)
      - Dependencies: `Batteries`
      - Note on versions and branches:
        - `ProofWidgets` uses a sequential version tagging scheme, e.g. `v0.0.29`,
          which does not refer to the toolchain being used.
        - Make a new release in this sequence after merging the toolchain bump PR.
        - `ProofWidgets` does not maintain a `stable` branch.
      - Toolchain bump PR
      - Create and push the tag, following the version convention of the repository
    - [Aesop](https://github.com/leanprover-community/aesop)
      - Dependencies: `Batteries`
      - Toolchain bump PR including updated Lake manifest
      - Create and push the tag
      - Merge the tag into `stable`
    - [doc-gen4](https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4)
      - Dependencies: exist, but they're not part of the release workflow
      - Toolchain bump PR including updated Lake manifest
      - Create and push the tag
      - There is no `stable` branch; skip this step
    - [import-graph](https://github.com/leanprover-community/import-graph)
      - Toolchain bump PR including updated Lake manifest
      - Create and push the tag
      - There is no `stable` branch; skip this step
    - [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4)
      - Dependencies: `Aesop`, `ProofWidgets4`, `lean4checker`, `Batteries`, `doc-gen4`, `import-graph`
      - Toolchain bump PR notes:
        - In addition to updating the `lean-toolchain` and `lakefile.lean`,
          in `.github/workflows/lean4checker.yml` update the line
          `git checkout v4.6.0` to the appropriate tag. 
        - Push the PR branch to the main Mathlib repository rather than a fork, or CI may not work reliably
        - Create and push the tag
        - Create a new branch from the tag, push it, and open a pull request against `stable`.
          Coordinate with a Mathlib maintainer to get this merged.
    - [REPL](https://github.com/leanprover-community/repl)
      - Dependencies: `Mathlib` (for test code)
      - Note that there are two copies of `lean-toolchain`/`lakefile.lean`:
        in the root, and in `test/Mathlib/`. Edit both, and run `lake update` in both directories.
      - Toolchain bump PR including updated Lake manifest
      - Create and push the tag
      - Merge the tag into `stable`
- Merge the release announcement PR for the Lean website - it will be deployed automatically
- Finally, make an announcement!
  This should go in https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113486-announce, with topic `v4.6.0`.
  Please see previous announcements for suggested language.
  You will want a few bullet points for main topics from the release notes.
  Link to the blog post from the Zulip announcement.
- Make sure that whoever is handling social media knows the release is out.

## Optimistic(?) time estimates:
- Initial checks and push the tag: 30 minutes.
- Note that if `RELEASES.md` has discrepancies this could take longer!
- Waiting for the release: 60 minutes.
- Fixing release notes: 10 minutes.
- Bumping toolchains in downstream repositories, up to creating the Mathlib PR: 30 minutes.
- Waiting for Mathlib CI and bors: 120 minutes.
- Finalizing Mathlib tags and stable branch, and updating REPL: 15 minutes.
- Posting announcement and/or blog post: 20 minutes.

# Creating a release candidate.

This checklist walks you through creating the first release candidate for a version of Lean.

We'll use `v4.7.0-rc1` as the intended release version in this example.

- Decide which nightly release you want to turn into a release candidate.
  We will use `nightly-2024-02-29` in this example.
- It is essential that Batteries and Mathlib already have reviewed branches compatible with this nightly.
  - Check that both Batteries and Mathlib's `bump/v4.7.0` branch contain `nightly-2024-02-29`
    in their `lean-toolchain`.
  - The steps required to reach that state are beyond the scope of this checklist, but see below!
- Create the release branch from this nightly tag:
    ```
    git remote add nightly https://github.com/leanprover/lean4-nightly.git
    git fetch nightly tag nightly-2024-02-29
    git checkout nightly-2024-02-29
    git checkout -b releases/v4.7.0
    ```
- In `RELEASES.md` remove `(development in progress)` from the `v4.7.0` section header.
- Our current goal is to have written release notes only about major language features or breaking changes,
  and to rely on automatically generated release notes for bugfixes and minor changes.
  - Do not wait on `RELEASES.md` being perfect before creating the `release/v4.7.0` branch. It is essential to choose the nightly which will become the release candidate as early as possible, to avoid confusion.
  - If there are major changes not reflected in `RELEASES.md` already, you may need to solicit help from the authors.
  - Minor changes and bug fixes do not need to be documented in `RELEASES.md`: they will be added automatically on the Github release page.
  - Commit your changes to `RELEASES.md`, and push.
  - Remember that changes to `RELEASES.md` after you have branched `releases/v4.7.0` should also be cherry-picked back to `master`.
- In `src/CMakeLists.txt`,
  - verify that you see `set(LEAN_VERSION_MINOR 7)` (for whichever `7` is appropriate); this should already have been updated when the development cycle began.
  - `set(LEAN_VERSION_IS_RELEASE 1)` (this should be a change; on `master` and nightly releases it is always `0`).
  - Commit your changes to `src/CMakeLists.txt`, and push.
- `git tag v4.7.0-rc1`
- `git push origin v4.7.0-rc1`
- Now wait, while CI runs.
  - You can monitor this at `https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/actions/workflows/ci.yml`, looking for the `v4.7.0-rc1` tag.
  - This step can take up to an hour.
- Once the release appears at https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/releases/
  - Edit the release notes on Github to select the "Set as a pre-release box".
  - Copy the section of `RELEASES.md` for this version into the Github release notes.
  - Use the title "Changes since v4.6.0 (from RELEASES.md)"
  - Then in the "previous tag" dropdown, select `v4.6.0`, and click "Generate release notes".
  - This will add a list of all the commits since the last stable version.
    - Delete anything already mentioned in the hand-written release notes above.
    - Delete "update stage0" commits, and anything with a completely inscrutable commit message.
    - Briefly rearrange the remaining items by category (e.g. `simp`, `lake`, `bug fixes`),
      but for minor items don't put any work in expanding on commit messages.
  - (How we want to release notes to look is evolving: please update this section if it looks wrong!)
- Next, we will move a curated list of downstream repos to the release candidate.
  - This assumes that there is already a *reviewed* branch `bump/v4.7.0` on each repository
    containing the required adaptations (or no adaptations are required).
    The preparation of this branch is beyond the scope of this document.
  - For each of the target repositories:
    - Checkout the `bump/v4.7.0` branch.
    - Verify that the `lean-toolchain` is set to the nightly from which the release candidate was created.
    - `git merge origin/master`
    - Change the `lean-toolchain` to `leanprover/lean4:v4.7.0-rc1`
    - In `lakefile.lean`, change any dependencies which were using `nightly-testing` or `bump/v4.7.0` branches
      back to `master` or `main`, and run `lake update` for those dependencies.
    - Run `lake build` to ensure that dependencies are found (but it's okay to stop it after a moment).
    - `git commit`
    - `git push`
    - Open a PR from `bump/v4.7.0` to `master`, and either merge it yourself after CI, if appropriate,
      or notify the maintainers that it is ready to go.
    - Once this PR has been merged, tag `master` with `v4.7.0-rc1` and push this tag.
  - We do this for the same list of repositories as for stable releases, see above.
    As above, there are dependencies between these, and so the process above is iterative.
    It greatly helps if you can merge the `bump/v4.7.0` PRs yourself!
  - For Batteries/Aesop/Mathlib, which maintain a `nightly-testing` branch, make sure there is a tag
    `nightly-testing-2024-02-29` with date corresponding to the nightly used for the release
    (create it if not), and then on the `nightly-testing` branch `git reset --hard master`, and force push.
- Make an announcement!
  This should go in https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113486-announce, with topic `v4.7.0-rc1`.
  Please see previous announcements for suggested language.
  You will want a few bullet points for main topics from the release notes.
  Please also make sure that whoever is handling social media knows the release is out.
- Begin the next development cycle (i.e. for `v4.8.0`) on the Lean repository, by making a PR that:
  - Updates `src/CMakeLists.txt` to say `set(LEAN_VERSION_MINOR 8)`
  - Removes `(in development)` from the section heading in `RELEASES.md` for `v4.7.0`,
    and creates a new `v4.8.0 (in development)` section heading.

## Time estimates:
Slightly longer than the corresponding steps for a stable release.
Similar process, but more things go wrong.
In particular, updating the downstream repositories is significantly more work
(because we need to merge existing `bump/v4.7.0` branches, not just update a toolchain).

# Preparing `bump/v4.7.0` branches

While not part of the release process per se,
this is a brief summary of the work that goes into updating Batteries/Aesop/Mathlib to new versions.

Please read https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/tags_and_branches.html

* Each repo has an unreviewed `nightly-testing` branch that
  receives commits automatically from `master`, and
  has its toolchain updated automatically for every nightly.
  (Note: the aesop branch is not automated, and is updated on an as needed basis.)
  As a consequence this branch is often broken.
  A bot posts in the (private!) "Mathlib reviewers" stream on Zulip about the status of these branches.
* We fix the breakages by committing directly to `nightly-testing`: there is no PR process.
  * This can either be done by the person managing this process directly,
    or by soliciting assistance from authors of files, or generally helpful people on Zulip!
* Each repo has a `bump/v4.7.0` which accumulates reviewed changes adapting to new versions.
* Once `nightly-testing` is working on a given nightly, say `nightly-2024-02-15`, we:
  * Make sure `bump/v4.7.0` is up to date with `master` (by merging `master`, no PR necessary)
  * Create from `bump/v4.7.0` a `bump/nightly-2024-02-15` branch.
  * In that branch, `git merge --squash nightly-testing` to bring across changes from `nightly-testing`.
  * Sanity check changes, commit, and make a PR to `bump/v4.7.0` from the `bump/nightly-2024-02-15` branch.
  * Solicit review, merge the PR into `bump/v4,7,0`.
* It is always okay to merge in the following directions:
  `master` -> `bump/v4.7.0` -> `bump/nightly-2024-02-15` -> `nightly-testing`.
  Please remember to push any merges you make to intermediate steps!

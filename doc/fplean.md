Functional Programming in Lean
=======================

The goal of [this book](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/) is to be an accessible introduction to using Lean 4 as a programming language.
It should be useful both to people who want to use Lean as a general-purpose programming language and to mathematicians who want to develop larger-scale proof automation but do not have a background in functional programming.
It does not assume any background with functional programming, though it's probably not a good first book on programming in general.
New content will be added once per month until it's done.

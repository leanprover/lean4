Lean for Windows
----------------

A native Lean binary for Windows can be generated using [msys2].
It is easy to install all dependencies, it produces native
64/32-binaries, and supports a C++14 compiler.


## Installing dependencies

[The official webpage of msys2][msys2] provides one-click installers.
Once installed it, you should run the "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit shell" from the start menu.
Do not run "MSYS2 MSYS" instead!
MSYS2 MinGW has a package management system, [pacman][pacman], which is used in Arch Linux.

Here are the commands to install all dependencies needed to compile Lean on your machine.

```bash
pacman -S make python mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-ccache mingw-w64-x86_64-clang git
```

Then follow the [generic build instructions](index.md) in the [msys2] shell, using
`cmake ../.. -G "Unix Makefiles"` instead of `cmake ../..`. This ensures that cmake will call `sh` instead
of `cmd.exe` for script tasks.

## Install lean

You can use the `install` ninja/make target to install Lean into, by default,
`C:\\User Programs (x86)\\LEAN`. To change this, add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/you/want`
to your cmake invocation.

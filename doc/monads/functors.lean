# Functors

A `Functor` is any type that can act as a generic container that allows you to transform the
underlying values inside the container using a function, so that the values are all updated, but the
structure of the container is the same. This is called "mapping".

A List is the most basic example of a `Functor`.

A list contains zero or more elements of the same, underlying type.  When you `map` a function over
a list, you create a new list with the same number of elements, where each has been transformed by
the function:
-/
#eval [1,2,3].map (Î» x => toString x) -- ["1", "2", "3"]

/-!
Here we converted a list of natural numbers (Nat) to a list of strings where the lambda function
here used `toString` to do the transformation of each element. Notice that when we apply `map`
the "structure" of the object remains the same, in this case the resulting List is the same size.

List has a specialized version of `map` defined as follows:
-/
def map (f : Î± â†’ Î²) : List Î± â†’ List Î²
  | []    => []
  | a::as => f a :: map f as

/-!
This is a very generic `map` function that can take any function that converts `(Î± â†’ Î²)` and use it
to convert `List Î± â†’ List Î²`, notice the function call `f a` above which is producing the converted
items for the new list.

Lean also defines custom infix operator `<$>` for map which simply allows you to write this:
-/
#eval (Î» x => toString x) <$> [1, 2, 3] -- ["1", "2", "3"]
/-!

In this `Functor`, `map` is called a "higher order function" because it takes
a function as input `(Î± â†’ Î²)` and returns another function as output `F Î± â†’ F Î²`.

Let's look at some more examples:

-/
-- List String â†’ List Nat
#eval ["elephant", "tiger", "giraffe"].map (fun s => s.length)
-- [8, 5, 7]

-- List Nat â†’ List Float
#eval [1,2,3,4,5].map (fun s => (s.toFloat) ^ 3.0)
-- [1.000000, 8.000000, 27.000000, 64.000000, 125.000000]

--- List String â†’ List String
#eval (fun s => s.capitalize) <$> ["chris", "david", "mark"]
-- ["Chris", "David", "Mark"]
/-!

Another example of a functor is the `Option` type. Option contains a value or nothing and is handy
for code that has to deal with optional values, like optional command line arguments.

Remember you can construct an Option using the type constructors `some` or `none`:

-/
#check some 5 -- Option Nat
#eval some 5  -- some 5
#eval (some 5).map (fun x => x + 1) -- some 6
#eval (some 5).map (fun x => toString x) -- some "5"
/-!

Lean also provides a convenient short hand syntax for `(fun x => x + 1)`, namely `(Â· * 5)`
using the middle dot unicode character which you can type in VS code using `\. `.

-/
#eval (some 4).map (Â· * 5)  -- some 20
/-!

The `map` function preserves the `none` state of the Option, so again
map preserves the structure of the object.  Notice that even in the `none` case it has
transformed `Option Nat` into `Option String` as we see in the `#check` command below:

-/
def x : Option Nat := none
#eval x.map (fun x => toString x) -- none
#check x.map (fun x => toString x) -- Option String
/-!

## How to make a Functor Instance?

The `List` type is made a functor by the following `Functor` type class instance:

-/
instance : Functor List where
  map := List.map
/-!

Notice all you need to do is provide the map function implementation.  For a quick
example, let's supposed you have a type describing the measurements of a home
or apartment:

-/
structure LivingSpace (Î±: Type) where
  totalSize : Î±
  numBedrooms : Nat
  masterBedroomSize : Î±
  livingRoomSize : Î±
  kitchenSize : Î±
  deriving Repr, BEq
/-!

Now you can construct a LivingSpace in square feet using floating point values:
-/
abbrev SquareFeet := Float

def mySpace : LivingSpace SquareFeet :=
  { totalSize := 1800, numBedrooms := 4, masterBedroomSize := 500,
    livingRoomSize := 900, kitchenSize := 400 }
/-!

Now, suppose you want anyone to be able to map LivingSpaces from one type of measurement unit to
another.  Then you would provide a `Functor` instance as follows:

-/
def LivingSpace.map (f : Î± â†’ Î²) (s : LivingSpace Î±) : LivingSpace Î² :=
  { totalSize := f s.totalSize,
    numBedrooms := s.numBedrooms,
    masterBedroomSize := f s.masterBedroomSize,
    livingRoomSize := f s.livingRoomSize,
    kitchenSize := f s.kitchenSize }

instance : Functor LivingSpace where
  map := LivingSpace.map
/-!

Notice this functor instance takes `LivingSpace` and not the fully qualified type `LivingSpace SquareFeet`.
Notice below that `LivingSpace` is a function from Type to Type.  For example, if you give it type `SquareFeet`
it gives you back the fully qualified type `LivingSpace SquareFeet`.

-/
#check LivingSpace -- Type â†’ Type
/-!

So the `instance : Functor` then is operating on the more abstract, or generic `LivingSpace` saying
for the whole family of types `LivingSpace Î±` you can map to `LivingSpace Î²` using the generic
`LivingSpace.map` map function by simply providing a function that does the more primitive mapping
from `(f : Î± â†’ Î²)`.  So `LivingSpace.map` is a sort of function applicator.

Notice that our `LivingSpace.map` applies a function `f` to convert the units of all the LivingSpace
fields, except for `numBedrooms` which is a count (and therefore is not a measurement that needs
converting).

So now you can define a simple conversion function, let's say we want square meters instead:

-/
abbrev SquareMeters := Float
def squareFeetToMeters (ft : SquareFeet ) : SquareMeters := (ft / 10.7639104)
/-!

and now bringing it all together you can use the simple function `squareFeetToMeters` to map
`mySpace` to square meters:

-/
#eval squareFeetToMeters <$> mySpace
/-
{ totalSize := 167.225472,
  numBedrooms := 4,
  masterBedroomSize := 46.451520,
  livingRoomSize := 83.612736,
  kitchenSize := 37.161216 }
  -/
/-!

Wow, this is pretty powerful.  By providing a functor instance on `LivingSpace` with an
implementation of the `map` function we have made it super easy for anyone to come alone and
transform the units of a `LivingSpace` using very simple functions like `squareFeetToMeters`.
Notice that squareFeetToMeters knows nothing about `LivingSpace`.

You can implement the `Functor` pattern in other languages, people have even done it in C++,
but it is very clean and elegant in Lean.


## What are the Functor laws?

Functors have two laws: the identity law, and the composition law. These laws express behaviors that
your functor instances should follow. If they don't, other programmers will be very confused at the
effect your instances have on the program. Many structures have similar laws, including monads.

The identity law says that if you "map" the identity function (`id`) over your functor, the resulting
functor should be the same. A succinct way of stating this is:

-/
#eval id <$> mySpace == mySpace -- true
/-!

And you can prove this is the case with `mySpace` with the following Lean proof:

-/
example : mySpace.map id = mySpace := by
  simp[LivingSpace.map]  -- Goals accomplished ðŸŽ‰
/-!

The composition law says that if we "map" two functions in succession over our functor, this should
be the same as "composing" the functions and simply mapping that one super-function.  In Lean you
can compose two functions using `Function.comp f g` (or the syntax `f âˆ˜ g`, which you can type in VS
code using `\o`) and you will get the same results from both of these showing that the composition
law holds:

-/
#eval (squareFeetToMeters <$> (id <$> mySpace)) == ((squareFeetToMeters âˆ˜ id) <$> mySpace) -- true
/-!

To break these laws, you would have to do something like introducing an arbitrary value into the
instance that is not the identity value and is not based on the function `f : Î± â†’ Î²`
for example if you changed how you initialize numBedrooms from ` numBedrooms := s.numBedrooms`
to  `numBedrooms := 0,`.

If you zero out the number of bedrooms this will break the `id` law, and the theorem proving
`mySpace.map id = mySpace` now fails.  Similarly, `numBedrooms := s.numBedrooms + s.numBedrooms` would
also break the `id` law.  So it's best to stick with an identity transform or the given function `f` in
your map implementations.

# How do Functors help with Monads ?

Functors are an abstract mathematical structure that we represent in Lean with a type class. The
Lean functor defines both `map` and a special case for working on constants more efficiently called
`mapConst`:

-/
class Functor (f : Type u â†’ Type v) : Type (max (u+1) v) where
  map : {Î± Î² : Type u} â†’ (Î± â†’ Î²) â†’ f Î± â†’ f Î²
  mapConst : {Î± Î² : Type u} â†’ Î± â†’ f Î² â†’ f Î±
/-!

In general then, a functor is a function on types `F : Type u â†’ Type v` equipped with an operator
called `map` such that if you have a function `f` of type `Î± â†’ Î²` then `map f` will convert your
container type from `F Î± â†’ F Î²`.
This corresponds to the category-theory notion of
[functor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor) in the special case where the category is the
category of types and functions between them.

This `Functor` has particular "laws" associated with it that dictate its expected behavior. Monads
are the same way! However, functors are simpler to understand. The functor type class has only the
`map` function and two straightforward laws. We can easily visualize what they do. Monads meanwhile
have multiple functions and several more complicated laws.

Understanding abstract mathematical structures is a little tricky for most people. So it helps to
start with a simpler idea like functors before we try to understand monads.

# Syntax Extensions

Lean's syntax can be extended and customized by users at every level, ranging from basic "mixfix" notations to custom elaborators.
In fact, all builtin syntax is parsed and processed using the same mechanisms and APIs open to users.
In this section, we will describe and explain the various extension points.
Significant syntax extensions already builtin into Lean such as the [`do` notation](./do.md) are described in subsections.

While introducing new notations is a relatively rare feature in programming languages and sometimes even frowned upon because of its potential to obscure code, it is an invaluable tool in formalization for expressing established conventions and notations of the respective field succinctly in code.
Going beyond basic notations, Lean's ability to factor out common boilerplate code into (well-behaved) macros and to embed entire custom domain specific languages (DSLs) to textually encode subproblems efficiently and readably can be of great benefit to both programmers and proof engineers alike.

## Notations and Precedence

The most basic syntax extension commands allow introducing new (or overloading existing) prefix, infix, and postfix operators.

```lean
infixl:65 " + "  => HAdd.hAdd  -- left-associative
infix:70  " * "  => HMul.hMul  -- ditto
infixr:80 " ^ "  => HPow.hPow  -- right-associative
prefix:100 "-"   => Neg.neg
postfix:max "⁻¹" => Inv.inv
```

After the initial command name describing the operator kind (its "fixity"), we give the *parsing precedence* of the operator preceded by a colon `:`, then a new or existing token surrounded by double quotes (the whitespace is used for pretty printing), then the function this operator should be translated to after the arrow `=>`.

The precedence is a natural number describing how "tightly" an operator binds to its arguments, encoding the order of operations.
We can make this more precise by looking at the commands above unfold to:

```lean
notation:65 lhs " + " rhs:66 => HAdd.hAdd lhs rhs
notation:70 lhs " * " rhs:71 => HMul.hMul lhs rhs
notation:80 lhs " ^ " rhs:80 => HPow.hPow lhs rhs
notation:100 "-" arg:100 => Neg.neg arg
notation:1000 arg "⁻¹" => Inv.inv arg  -- `max` is a shorthand for precedence 1000
```

It turns out that all commands from the first code block are in fact command *macros* translating to the more general `notation` command.
We will learn about writing such macros below.
Instead of a single token, the `notation` command accepts a mixed sequence of tokens and named term placeholders with precedences, which can be referenced on the right-hand side of `=>` and will be replaced by the respective term parsed at that position.
A placeholder with precedence `p` accepts only notations with precedence at least `p` in that place.
Thus the string `a + b + c` cannot be parsed as the equivalent of `a + (b + c)` because the right-hand side operand of an `infixl` notation has precedence one greater than the notation itself.
In contrast, `infixr` reuses the notation's precedence for the right-hand side operand, so `a ^ b ^ c` *can* be parsed as `a ^ (b ^ c)`.
Note that the left-hand side operand as a leading placeholder does not and cannot take a precedence because Lean uses a *left-to-right, left-most derivation* parser, or *LL* parser, so when it encounters e.g. the `+` token, the term `lhs` has already been parsed and there is nothing left to check.
You might wonder, then, what prevents Lean from parsing `a ^ b ^ c` as `(a ^ b) ^ c` instead when there is no precedence restriction on the first operand.
The answer is that Lean's parser follows a local *longest parse* rule in the presence of ambiguous grammars: when parsing the right-hand side of `a ^`, it will continue parsing as long as possible (as the current precedence allows), not stopping after `b` but parsing `^ c` as well.

As mentioned above, the `notation` command allows us to define arbitrary *mixfix* syntax freely mixing tokens and placeholders.
```lean
notation:max "(" e ")" => e
notation:10 Γ " ⊢ " e " : " τ => Typing Γ e τ
```
Placeholders without precedence default to `0`, i.e. they accept notations of any precedence in their place.
If two notations overlap, we again apply the longest parse rule:
```lean
notation:65 a " + " b:66 " + " c:66 => a + b - c
#eval 1 + 2 + 3  -- 0
```
The new notation is preferred to the binary notation since the latter, before chaining, would stop parsing after `1 + 2`.
If there are multiple notations accepting the same longest parse, the choice will be delayed until elaboration, which will fail unless exactly one overload is type correct.

### Language features, tactics, and metaprograms

* `bv_decide` tactic. This release introduces a new tactic for proving goals involving `BitVec` and `Bool`. It reduces the goal to a SAT instance that is refuted by an external solver, and the resulting LRAT proof is checked in Lean. This is used to synthesize a proof of the goal by reflection. As this process uses verified algorithms, proofs generated by this tactic use `Lean.ofReduceBool`, so this tactic includes the Lean compiler as part of the trusted code base. The external solver CaDiCaL is included with Lean and does not need to be installed separately to make use of `bv_decide`.

  For example, we can use `bv_decide` to verify that a bit twiddling formula leaves at most one bit set:
  ```lean
  def popcount (x : BitVec 64) : BitVec 64 :=
    let rec go (x pop : BitVec 64) : Nat ‚Üí BitVec 64
      | 0 => pop
      | n + 1 => go (x >>> 2) (pop + (x &&& 1)) n
    go x 0 64

  example (x : BitVec 64) : popcount ((x &&& (x - 1)) ^^^ x) ‚â§ 1 := by
    simp only [popcount, popcount.go]
    bv_decide
  ```
  When the external solver fails to refute the SAT instance generated by `bv_decide`, it can report a counterexample:
  ```lean
  /--
  error: The prover found a counterexample, consider the following assignment:
  x = 0xffffffffffffffff#64
  -/
  #guard_msgs in
  example (x : BitVec 64) : x < x + 1 := by
    bv_decide
  ```

  See `Lean.Elab.Tactic.BVDecide` for a more detailed overview, and look in `tests/lean/run/bv_*` for examples.

  * [#5018](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5018) enables infotrees on the command line for ilean generation.
  * [#5040](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5040) and [#5056](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5056) improve performance of info trees.
  * [#5090](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5090) disables incrementality in the `case .. | ..` tactic.
  * [#5312](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5312) fixes a bug where changing whitespace after the module header could break subsequent commands.

* **Definitions**
  * [#5016](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5016) and [#5066](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5066) add `clean_wf` tactic to clean up tactic state in `decreasing_by`. This can be disabled with `set_option debug.rawDecreasingByGoal false`.
  * [#5055](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5055) unifies equational theorems between structural and well-founded recursion.
  * [#5041](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5041) allows mutually recursive functions to use different parameter names among the ‚Äúfixed parameter prefix‚Äù
  * [#4154](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4154) and [#5109](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5109) add fine-grained equational lemmas for non-recursive functions. See breaking changes.
  * [#5129](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5129) unifies equation lemmas for recursive and non-recursive definitions. The `backward.eqns.deepRecursiveSplit` option can be set to `false` to get the old behavior. See breaking changes.
  * [#5141](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5141) adds `f.eq_unfold` lemmas. Now Lean produces the following zoo of rewrite rules:
    ```
    Option.map.eq_1      : Option.map f none = none
    Option.map.eq_2      : Option.map f (some x) = some (f x)
    Option.map.eq_def    : Option.map f p = match o with | none => none | (some x) => some (f x)
    Option.map.eq_unfold : Option.map = fun f p => match o with | none => none | (some x) => some (f x)
    ```
    The `f.eq_unfold` variant is especially useful to rewrite with `rw` under binders.

  * [#5037](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5037) improves strength of the tactic that proves array indexing is in bounds.
  * [#5119](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5119) fixes a bug in the tactic that proves indexing is in bounds where it could loop in the presence of mvars.
  * [#5072](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5072) makes the structure type clickable in "not a field of structure" errors for structure instance notation.
  * [#4717](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4717) fixes a bug where mutual `inductive` commands could create terms that the kernel rejects.
  * [#5142](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5142) fixes a bug where `variable` could fail when mixing binder updates and declarations.

* **Other fixes or improvements**

  * [#5173](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5173) uses the emoji variant selector for ‚úÖÔ∏è,‚ùåÔ∏è,üí•Ô∏è in messages, improving fonts selection.
  * [#5183](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5183) fixes a bug in `rename_i` where implementation detail hypotheses could be renamed.

### Language server, widgets, and IDE extensions

* [#4821](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4821) resolves two language server bugs that especially affect Windows users. (1) Editing the header could result in the watchdog not correctly restarting the file worker, which would lead to the file seemingly being processed forever. (2) On an especially slow Windows machine, we found that starting the language server would sometimes not succeed at all. This PR also resolves an issue where we would not correctly emit messages that we received while the file worker is being restarted to the corresponding file worker after the restart.
* [#5006](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5006) updates the user widget manual.
* [#5193](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5193) updates the quickstart guide with the new display name for the Lean 4 extension ("Lean 4").
* [#5185](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5185) fixes a bug where over time "import out of date" messages would accumulate.
* [#4900](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4900) improves ilean loading performance by about a factor of two. Optimizes the JSON parser and the conversion from JSON to Lean data structures; see PR description for details.
* **Other fixes or improvements**
  * [#5031](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5031) localizes an instance in `Lsp.Diagnostics`.

### Pretty printing

* [#4976](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4976) introduces `@[app_delab]`, a macro for creating delaborators for particular constants. The `@[app_delab ident]` syntax resolves `ident` to its constant name `name` and then expands to `@[delab app.name]`.
* [#4982](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4982) fixes a bug where the pretty printer assumed structure projections were type correct (such terms can appear in type mismatch errors). Improves hoverability of `#print` output for structures.
* [#5218](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5218) and [#5239](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5239) add `pp.exprSizes` debugging option. When true, each pretty printed expression is prefixed with `[size a/b/c]`, where `a` is the size without sharing, `b` is the actual size, and `c` is the size with the maximum possible sharing.

### Library

* [#5020](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5020) swaps the parameters to `Membership.mem`. A purpose of this change is to make set-like `CoeSort` coercions to refer to the eta-expanded function `fun x => Membership.mem s x`, which can reduce in many computations. Another is that having the `s` argument first leads to better discrimination tree keys. (See breaking changes.)
* `Array`
  * [#4970](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4970) adds `@[ext]` attribute to `Array.ext`.
  * [#4957](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4957) deprecates `Array.get_modify`.

### Breaking changes

* [LibUV](https://libuv.org/) is now required to build Lean. This change only affects developers who compile Lean themselves instead of obtaining toolchains via `elan`. We have updated the official build instructions with information on how to obtain LibUV on our supported platforms. ([#4963](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4963))

* Recursive definitions with a `decreasing_by` clause that begins with `simp_wf` may break. Try removing `simp_wf` or replacing it with `simp`. ([#5016](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5016))

* The behavior of `rw [f]` where `f` is a non-recursive function defined by pattern matching changed.

  For example, preciously, `rw [Option.map]` would rewrite `Option.map f o` to `match o with ‚Ä¶ `. Now this rewrite fails because it will use the equational lemmas, and these require constructors ‚Äì just like for `List.map`.

  Remedies:
  * Split on `o` before rewriting.
  * Use `rw [Option.map.eq_def]`, which rewrites any (saturated) application of `Option.map`.
  * Use `set_option backward.eqns.nonrecursive false` when *defining* the function in question.
  ([#4154](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4154))

* The unified handling of equation lemmas for recursive and non-recursive functions can break existing code, as there now can be extra equational lemmas:

  * Explicit uses of `f.eq_2` might have to be adjusted if the numbering changed.

  * Uses of `rw [f]` or `simp [f]` may no longer apply if they previously matched (and introduced a `match` statement), when the equational lemmas got more fine-grained.

    In this case either case analysis on the parameters before rewriting helps, or setting the option `backward.eqns.deepRecursiveSplit false` while *defining* the function.

  ([#5129](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5129), [#5207](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5207))

* The `reduceCtorEq` simproc is now optional, and it might need to be included in lists of simp lemmas, like `simp only [reduceCtorEq]`. This simproc is responsible for reducing equalities of constructors. ([#5167](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5167))

* `Nat.strongInductionOn` is now `Nat.strongRecOn` and `Nat.caseStrongInductionOn` to `Nat.caseStrongRecOn`. ([#5147](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5147))

* The parameters to `Membership.mem` have been swapped, which affects all `Membership` instances. ([#5020](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5020))

* The meanings of `List.getElem_drop` and `List.getElem_drop'` have been reversed and the first is now a simp lemma. ([#5210](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/5210))

* The `Parsec` library has moved from `Lean.Data.Parsec` to `Std.Internal.Parsec`. The `Parsec` type is now more general with a parameter for an iterable. Users parsing strings can migrate to `Parser` in the `Std.Internal.Parsec.String` namespace, which also includes string-focused parsing combinators. ([#4774](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4774))

* The `Lean` module has switched from `Lean.HashMap` and `Lean.HashSet` to `Std.HashMap` and `Std.HashSet` ([#4943](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4943)). `Lean.HashMap` and `Lean.HashSet` are now deprecated ([#4954](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4954)) and will be removed in a future release. Users of `Lean` APIs that interact with hash maps, for example `Lean.Environment.const2ModIdx`, might encounter minor breakage due to the following changes from `Lean.HashMap` to `Std.HashMap`:
  * query functions use the term `get` instead of `find`, ([#4943](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/4943))
  * the notation `map[key]` no longer returns an optional value but instead expects a proof that the key is present in the map. The previous behavior is available via the `map[key]?` notation.

# Coercion

Lean uses a somewhat elaborate system of typeclasses to drive the coercion system.
Here a *coercion* means an invisible function that is automatically inserted
to fix what would otherwise be a type error. For example, if we have:
```
def f (x : Nat) : Int := x
```
then this is clearly not type correct as is, because `x` has type `Nat` but
type `Int` is expected, and normally you will get an error message saying exactly that.
But before it shows that message, it will attempt to synthesize an instance of
`CoeT Nat x Int`, which will end up going through all the other typeclasses defined
below, to discover that there is an instance of `Coe Nat Int` defined.

This instance is defined as:
```
instance : Coe Nat Int := ⟨Int.ofNat⟩
```
so Lean will elaborate the original function `f` as if it said:
```
def f (x : Nat) : Int := Int.ofNat x
```
which is not a type error anymore.

You can also use the `↑` operator to explicitly indicate a coercion. Using `↑x`
instead of `x` in the example will result in the same output.

Because there are many polymorphic functions in Lean, it is often ambiguous where
the coercion can go. For example:
```
def f (x y : Nat) : Int := x + y
```
This could be either `↑x + ↑y` where `+` is the addition on `Int`, or `↑(x + y)`
where `+` is addition on `Nat`, or even `x + y` using a heterogeneous addition
with the type `Nat → Nat → Int`. You can use the `↑` operator to disambiguate
between these possibilities, but generally Lean will elaborate working from the
"outside in", meaning that it will first look at the expression `_ + _ : Int`
and assign the `+` to be the one for `Int`, and then need to insert coercions
for the subterms `↑x : Int` and `↑y : Int`, resulting in the `↑x + ↑y` version.

Note that unlike most operators like `+`, `↑` is always eagerly unfolded at
parse time into its definition. So if we look at the definition of `f` from
before, we see no trace of the `CoeT.coe` function:
```
def f (x : Nat) : Int := x
#print f
-- def f : Nat → Int :=
-- fun (x : Nat) => Int.ofNat x
```

## Important typeclasses

Lean resolves a coercion by either inserting a `CoeDep` instance
or chaining `CoeHead? CoeOut* Coe* CoeTail?` instances.
(That is, zero or one `CoeHead` instances, an arbitrary number of `CoeOut`
instances, etc.)

The `CoeHead? CoeOut*` instances are chained from the "left" side.
So if Lean looks for a coercion from `Nat` to `Int`, it starts by trying coerce
`Nat` using `CoeHead` by looking for a `CoeHead Nat ?α` instance, and then
continuing with `CoeOut`.  Similarly `Coe* CoeTail?` are chained from the "right".

These classes should be implemented for coercions:

* `Coe α β` is the most basic class, and the usual one you will want to use
  when implementing a coercion for your own types.
  The variables in the type `α` must be a subset of the variables in `β`
  (or out-params of type class parameters),
  because `Coe` is chained right-to-left.

* `CoeOut α β` is like `Coe α β` but chained left-to-right.
  Use this if the variables in the type `α` are a superset of the variables in `β`.

* `CoeTail α β` is like `Coe α β`, but only applied once.
  Use this for coercions that would cause loops, like `[Ring R] → CoeTail Nat R`.

* `CoeHead α β` is similar to `CoeOut α β`, but only applied once.
  Use this for coercions that would cause loops, like `[SetLike S α] → CoeHead S (Set α)`.

* `CoeDep α (x : α) β` allows `β` to depend not only on `α` but on the value
  `x : α` itself. This is useful when the coercion function is dependent.
  An example of a dependent coercion is the instance for `Prop → Bool`, because
  it only holds for `Decidable` propositions. It is defined as:
  ```
  instance (p : Prop) [Decidable p] : CoeDep Prop p Bool := ...
  ```

* `CoeFun α (γ : α → Sort v)` is a coercion to a function. `γ a` should be a
  (coercion-to-)function type, and this is triggered whenever an element
  `f : α` appears in an application like `f x` which would not make sense since
  `f` does not have a function type.
  `CoeFun` instances apply to `CoeOut` as well.

* `CoeSort α β` is a coercion to a sort. `β` must be a universe, and if
  `a : α` appears in a place where a type is expected, like `(x : a)` or `a → a`.
  `CoeSort` instances apply to `CoeOut` as well.

On top of these instances this file defines several auxiliary type classes:
  * `CoeTC := Coe*`
  * `CoeOTC := CoeOut* Coe*`
  * `CoeHTC := CoeHead? CoeOut* Coe*`
  * `CoeHTCT := CoeHead? CoeOut* Coe* CoeTail?`
  * `CoeDep := CoeHead? CoeOut* Coe* CoeTail? | CoeDep`

`Coe α β` is the typeclass for coercions from `α` to `β`. It can be transitively
chained with other `Coe` instances, and coercion is automatically used when
`x` has type `α` but it is used in a context where `β` is expected.
You can use the `↑x` operator to explicitly trigger coercion.

`CoeDep α (x : α) β` is a typeclass for dependent coercions, that is, the type `β`
can depend on `x` (or rather, the value of `x` is available to typeclass search
so an instance that relates `β` to `x` is allowed).

Dependent coercions do not participate in the transitive chaining process of
regular coercions: they must exactly match the type mismatch on both sides.

`CoeT` is the core typeclass which is invoked by Lean to resolve a type error.
It can also be triggered explicitly with the notation `↑x` or by double type
ascription `((x : α) : β)`.

`CoeFun α (γ : α → Sort v)` is a coercion to a function. `γ a` should be a
(coercion-to-)function type, and this is triggered whenever an element
`f : α` appears in an application like `f x` which would not make sense since
`f` does not have a function type. This is automatically turned into `CoeFun.coe f x`.

`CoeSort α β` is a coercion to a sort. `β` must be a universe, and if

/--
`↑x` represents a coercion, which converts `x` of type `α` to type `β`, using
typeclasses to resolve a suitable conversion function. You can often leave the
`↑` off entirely, since coercion is triggered implicitly whenever there is a
type error, but in ambiguous cases it can be useful to use `↑` to disambiguate
between e.g. `↑x + ↑y` and `↑(x + y)`.

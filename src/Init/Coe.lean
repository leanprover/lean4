# Coercion

Lean uses a somewhat elaborate system of typeclasses to drive the coercion system.
Here a *coercion* means an invisible function that is automatically inserted
to fix what would otherwise be a type error. For example, if we have:
```
def f (x : Nat) : Int := x
```
then this is clearly not type correct as is, because `x` has type `Nat` but
type `Int` is expected, and normally you will get an error message saying exactly that.
But before it shows that message, it will attempt to synthesize an instance of
`CoeT Nat x Int`, which will end up going through all the other typeclasses defined
below, to discover that there is an instance of `Coe Nat Int` defined.

This instance is defined as:
```
instance : Coe Nat Int := ⟨Int.ofNat⟩
```
so Lean will elaborate the original function `f` as if it said:
```
def f (x : Nat) : Int := Int.ofNat x
```
which is not a type error anymore.

You can also use the `↑` operator to explicitly indicate a coercion. Using `↑x`
instead of `x` in the example will result in the same output.
Because there are many polymorphic functions in Lean, it is often ambiguous where
the coercion can go. For example:
```
def f (x y : Nat) : Int := x + y
```
This could be either `↑x + ↑y` where `+` is the addition on `Int`, or `↑(x + y)`
where `+` is addition on `Nat`, or even `x + y` using a heterogeneous addition
with the type `Nat → Nat → Int`. You can use the `↑` operator to disambiguate
between these possibilities, but generally Lean will elaborate working from the
"outside in", meaning that it will first look at the expression `_ + _ : Int`
and assign the `+` to be the one for `Int`, and then need to insert coercions
for the subterms `↑x : Int` and `↑y : Int`, resulting in the `↑x + ↑y` version.

## Important typeclasses

* `Coe α β` is the most basic class, and the usual one you will want to use
  when implementing a coercion for your own types.

* `CoeDep α (x : α) β` allows `β` to depend not only on `α` but on the value
  `x : α` itself. This is useful when the coercion function is dependent.
  An example of a dependent coercion is the instance for `Prop → Bool`, because
  it only holds for `Decidable` propositions. It is defined as:
  ```
  instance (p : Prop) [Decidable p] : CoeDep Prop p Bool := ...
  ```

* `CoeFun α (γ : α → Sort v)` is a coercion to a function. `γ a` should be a
  (coercion-to-)function type, and this is triggered whenever an element
  `f : α` appears in an application like `f x` which would not make sense since
  `f` does not have a function type. This is automatically turned into `CoeFun.coe f x`.

* `CoeSort α β` is a coercion to a sort. `β` must be a universe, and if
  `a : α` appears in a place where a type is expected, like `(x : a)` or `a → a`,
  then it will be turned into `(x : CoeSort.coe a)`.

* `CoeHead` is like `Coe`, but while `Coe` can be transitively chained in the
  `CoeT` class, `CoeHead` can only appear once and only at the start of such a
  chain. This is useful when the transitive instances are not well behaved.

* `CoeTail` is similar: it can only appear at the end of a chain of coercions.

* `CoeT α (x : α) β` itself is the combination of all the aforementioned classes
  (except `CoeSort` and `CoeFun` which have different triggers). You can
  implement `CoeT` if you do not want this coercion to be transitively composed
  with any other coercions.

Note that unlike most operators like `+`, `↑` is always eagerly unfolded at
parse time into its definition. So if we look at the definition of `f` from
before, we see no trace of the `CoeT.coe` function:
```
def f (x : Nat) : Int := x
#print f
-- def f : Nat → Int :=
-- fun (x : Nat) => Int.ofNat x
```

`Coe α β` is the typeclass for coercions from `α` to `β`. It can be transitively
chained with other `Coe` instances, and coercion is automatically used when
`x` has type `α` but it is used in a context where `β` is expected.
You can use the `↑x` operator to explicitly trigger coercion.
-/
class Coe (α : Sort u) (β : Sort v) where
  /-- Coerces a value of type `α` to type `β`. Accessible by the notation `↑x`,
  or by double type ascription `((x : α) : β)`. -/
  coe : α → β

/--
Auxiliary class that contains the transitive closure of `Coe`.
Users should generally not implement this directly.
-/
class CoeTC (α : Sort u) (β : Sort v) where
  /-- Coerces a value of type `α` to type `β`. Accessible by the notation `↑x`,
  or by double type ascription `((x : α) : β)`. -/
  coe : α → β

/--
`CoeHead α β` is for coercions that can only appear at the beginning of a
sequence of coercions. That is, `β` can be further coerced via `Coe β γ` and
`CoeTail γ δ` instances but `α` will only be the inferred type of the input.
-/
class CoeHead (α : Sort u) (β : Sort v) where
  /-- Coerces a value of type `α` to type `β`. Accessible by the notation `↑x`,
  or by double type ascription `((x : α) : β)`. -/
  coe : α → β

/--
`CoeTail α β` is for coercions that can only appear at the end of a
sequence of coercions. That is, `α` can be further coerced via `Coe σ α` and
`CoeHead τ σ` instances but `β` will only be the expected type of the expression.
-/
class CoeTail (α : Sort u) (β : Sort v) where
  /-- Coerces a value of type `α` to type `β`. Accessible by the notation `↑x`,
  or by double type ascription `((x : α) : β)`. -/
  coe : α → β

/--
Auxiliary class that contains `CoeHead` + `CoeTC` + `CoeTail`.

A `CoeHTCT` chain has the "grammar" `(CoeHead)? (Coe)* (CoeTail)?`, except that
the empty sequence is not allowed.
-/
class CoeHTCT (α : Sort u) (β : Sort v) where
  /-- Coerces a value of type `α` to type `β`. Accessible by the notation `↑x`,
  or by double type ascription `((x : α) : β)`. -/
  coe : α → β

/--
`CoeDep α (x : α) β` is a typeclass for dependent coercions, that is, the type `β`
can depend on `x` (or rather, the value of `x` is available to typeclass search
so an instance that relates `β` to `x` is allowed).

Dependent coercions do not participate in the transitive chaining process of
regular coercions: they must exactly match the type mismatch on both sides.
-/
class CoeDep (α : Sort u) (_ : α) (β : Sort v) where
  /-- The resulting value of type `β`. The input `x : α` is a parameter to
  the type class, so the value of type `β` may possibly depend on additional
  typeclasses on `x`. -/
  coe : β

/--
`CoeT` is the core typeclass which is invoked by Lean to resolve a type error.
It can also be triggered explicitly with the notation `↑x` or by double type
ascription `((x : α) : β)`.

A `CoeT` chain has the "grammar" `(CoeHead)? (Coe)* (CoeTail)? | CoeDep`,
except that the empty sequence is not allowed (identity coercions don't need
the coercion system at all).
-/
class CoeT (α : Sort u) (_ : α) (β : Sort v) where
  /-- The resulting value of type `β`. The input `x : α` is a parameter to
  the type class, so the value of type `β` may possibly depend on additional
  typeclasses on `x`. -/
  coe : β


/--
`CoeFun α (γ : α → Sort v)` is a coercion to a function. `γ a` should be a
(coercion-to-)function type, and this is triggered whenever an element
`f : α` appears in an application like `f x` which would not make sense since
`f` does not have a function type. This is automatically turned into `CoeFun.coe f x`.
-/
class CoeFun (α : Sort u) (γ : outParam (α → Sort v)) where
  /-- Coerces a value `f : α` to type `γ f`, which should be either be a
  function type or another `CoeFun` type, in order to resolve a mistyped
  application `f x`. -/
  coe : (f : α) → γ f

/--
`CoeSort α β` is a coercion to a sort. `β` must be a universe, and if
`a : α` appears in a place where a type is expected, like `(x : a)` or `a → a`,
then it will be turned into `(x : CoeSort.coe a)`.
-/
class CoeSort (α : Sort u) (β : outParam (Sort v)) where
  /-- Coerces a value of type `α` to `β`, which must be a universe. -/
  coe : α → β

/--
`↑x` represents a coercion, which converts `x` of type `α` to type `β`, using
typeclasses to resolve a suitable conversion function. You can often leave the
`↑` off entirely, since coercion is triggered implicitly whenever there is a
type error, but in ambiguous cases it can be useful to use `↑` to disambiguate
between e.g. `↑x + ↑y` and `↑(x + y)`.

Discards the value in a functor, retaining the functor's structure.

Discarding values is especially useful when using `Applicative` functors or `Monad`s to implement
effects, and some operation should be carried out only for its effects. In `do`-notation, statements
whose values are discarded must return `Unit`, and `discard` can be used to explicitly discard their
values.

An `Alternative` functor is an `Applicative` functor that can "fail" or be "empty"
and a binary operation `<|>` that “collects values” or finds the “left-most success”.

Important instances include
* `Option`, where `failure := none` and `<|>` returns the left-most `some`.
* Parser combinators typically provide an `Applicative` instance for error-handling and
  backtracking.

Error recovery and state can interact subtly. For example, the implementation of `Alternative` for `OptionT (StateT σ Id)` keeps modifications made to the state while recovering from failure, while `StateT σ (OptionT Id)` discards them.

# How `MonadControl` works

There is a [tutorial by Alexis King](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/09/07/demystifying-monadbasecontrol/) that this docstring is based on.

Suppose we have `foo : ∀ α, IO α → IO α` and `bar : StateT σ IO β` (ie, `bar : σ → IO (σ × β)`).
We might want to 'map' `bar` by `foo`. Concretely we would write this as:

```lean
opaque foo : ∀ {α}, IO α → IO α
opaque bar : StateT σ IO β

def mapped_foo : StateT σ IO β := do
  let s ← get
  let (b, s') ← liftM <| foo <| StateT.run bar s
  set s'
  return b
```

This is fine but it's not going to generalise, what if we replace `StateT Nat IO` with a large tower of monad transformers?
We would have to rewrite the above to handle each of the `run` functions for each transformer in the stack.

Is there a way to generalise `run` as a kind of inverse of `lift`?
We have `lift : m α → StateT σ m α` for all `m`, but we also need to 'unlift' the state.
But `unlift : StateT σ IO α → IO α` can't be implemented. So we need something else.

If we look at the definition of `mapped_foo`, we see that `lift <| foo <| StateT.run bar s`
has the type `IO (σ × β)`. The key idea is that `σ × β` contains all of the information needed to reconstruct the state and the new value.

Now lets define some values to generalise `mapped_foo`:
- Write `IO (σ × β)` as `IO (stM β)`
- Write `StateT.run . s` as `mapInBase : StateT σ IO α → IO (stM β)`
- Define `restoreM : IO (stM α) → StateT σ IO α` as below

```lean
def stM (α : Type) := α × σ

def restoreM (x : IO (stM α)) : StateT σ IO α := do
  let (a,s) ← liftM x
  set s
  return a
```

To get:

```lean
def mapped_foo' : StateT σ IO β := do
  let s ← get
  let mapInBase := fun z => StateT.run z s
  restoreM <| foo <| mapInBase bar
```

and finally define

```lean
def control {α : Type}
  (f : ({β : Type} → StateT σ IO β → IO (stM β)) → IO (stM α))
  : StateT σ IO α := do
  let s ← get
  let mapInBase := fun {β} (z : StateT σ IO β) => StateT.run z s
  let r : IO (stM α) := f mapInBase
  restoreM r
```

Now we can write `mapped_foo` as:

```lean
def mapped_foo'' : StateT σ IO β :=
  control (fun mapInBase => foo (mapInBase bar))
```

The core idea of `mapInBase` is that given any `β`, it runs an instance of
`StateT σ IO β` and 'packages' the result and state as  `IO (stM β)` so that it can be piped through `foo`.
Once it's been through `foo` we can then unpack the state again with `restoreM`.
Hence we can apply `foo` to `bar` without losing track of the state.

Here `stM β = σ × β` is the 'packaged result state', but we can generalise:
if we have a tower `StateT σ₁ <| StateT σ₂ <| IO`, then the
composite packaged state is going to be `stM₁₂ β := σ₁ × σ₂ × β` or `stM₁₂ := stM₁ ∘ stM₂`.

`MonadControl m n` means that when programming in the monad `n`,
we can switch to a base monad `m` using `control`, just like with `liftM`.
In contrast to `liftM`, however, we also get a function `runInBase` that
allows us to "lower" actions in `n` into `m`.
This is really useful when we have large towers of monad transformers, as we do in the metaprogramming library.

For example there is a function `withNewMCtxDepthImp : MetaM α → MetaM α` that runs the input monad instance
in a new nested metavariable context. We can lift this to `withNewMctxDepth : n α → n α` using `MonadControlT MetaM n`
(`MonadControlT` is the transitive closure of `MonadControl`).
Which means that we can also run `withNewMctxDepth` in the `Tactic` monad without needing to
faff around with lifts and all the other boilerplate needed in `mapped_foo`.

## Relationship to `MonadFunctor`

A stricter form of `MonadControl` is `MonadFunctor`, which defines
`monadMap {α} : (∀ {β}, m β → m β) → n α → n α`. Using `monadMap` it is also possible to define `mapped_foo` above.
However there are some mappings which can't be derived using `MonadFunctor`. For example:

```lean,ignore
 @[inline] def map1MetaM [MonadControlT MetaM n] [Monad n] (f : forall {α}, (β → MetaM α) → MetaM α) {α} (k : β → n α) : n α :=
   control fun runInBase => f fun b => runInBase <| k b

 @[inline] def map2MetaM [MonadControlT MetaM n] [Monad n] (f : forall {α}, (β → γ → MetaM α) → MetaM α) {α} (k : β → γ → n α) : n α :=
   control fun runInBase => f fun b c => runInBase <| k b c
```

In `monadMap`, we can only 'run in base' a single computation in `n` into the base monad `m`.
Using `control` means that `runInBase` can be used multiple times.

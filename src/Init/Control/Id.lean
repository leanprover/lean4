The identity Monad.
-/
prelude
import Init.Core

universe u

/--
The identity function on types, used primarily for its `Monad` instance.

The identity monad is useful together with monad transformers to construct monads for particular
purposes. Additionally, it can be used with `do`-notation in order to use control structures such as
local mutability, `for`-loops, and early returns in code that does not otherwise use monads.

Examples:
```lean example
def containsFive (xs : List Nat) : Bool := Id.run do
  for x in xs do
    if x == 5 then return true
  return false
```

```lean example
#eval containsFive [1, 3, 5, 7]
```
```output
true
```

def Id (type : Type u) : Type u := type

namespace Id

@[always_inline]
instance : Monad Id where
  pure x := x
  bind x f := f x
  map f x := f x

/--
The identity monad has a `bind` operator.
-/
def hasBind : Bind Id :=
  inferInstance

/--
Runs a computation in the identity monad.

This function is the identity function. Because its parameter has type `Id α`, it causes
`do`-notation in its arguments to use the `Monad Id` instance.

protected def run (x : Id α) : α := x

instance [OfNat α n] : OfNat (Id α) n :=
  inferInstanceAs (OfNat α n)

end Id

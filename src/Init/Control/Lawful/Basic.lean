A functor satisfies the functor laws.

The `Functor` class contains the operations of a functor, but does not require that instances
prove they satisfy the laws of a functor. A `LawfulFunctor` instance includes proofs that the laws
are satisfied. Because `Functor` instances may provide optimized implementations of `mapConst`,
`LawfulFunctor` instances must also prove that the optimized implementation is equivalent to the
standard implementation.

An applicative functor satisfies the laws of an applicative functor.

The `Applicative` class contains the operations of an applicative functor, but does not require that
instances prove they satisfy the laws of an applicative functor. A `LawfulApplicative` instance
includes proofs that the laws are satisfied.

Because `Applicative` instances may provide optimized implementations of `seqLeft` and `seqRight`,
`LawfulApplicative` instances must also prove that the optimized implementation is equivalent to the
standard implementation.

  Mapping a function over the result of `pure` is equivalent to applying the function under `pure`.

Lawful monads are those that satisfy a certain behavioral specification. While all instances of
`Monad` should satisfy these laws, not all implementations are required to prove this.

`LawfulMonad.mk'` is an alternative constructor that contains useful defaults for many fields.

# LawfulMonadLift and LawfulMonadLiftT

This module provides classes asserting that `MonadLift` and `MonadLiftT` are lawful, which means
that `monadLift` is compatible with `pure` and `bind`.

section MonadLift

/-- The `MonadLift` typeclass only contains the lifting operation. `LawfulMonadLift` further
  asserts that lifting commutes with `pure` and `bind`:
```
monadLift (pure a) = pure a
monadLift (ma >>= f) = monadLift ma >>= monadLift ∘ f
```
-/
class LawfulMonadLift (m : semiOutParam (Type u → Type v)) (n : Type u → Type w)
    [Monad m] [Monad n] [inst : MonadLift m n] : Prop where
  /-- Lifting preserves `pure` -/
  monadLift_pure {α : Type u} (a : α) : inst.monadLift (pure a) = pure a
  /-- Lifting preserves `bind` -/
  monadLift_bind {α β : Type u} (ma : m α) (f : α → m β) :
    inst.monadLift (ma >>= f) = inst.monadLift ma >>= (fun x => inst.monadLift (f x))

/-- The `MonadLiftT` typeclass only contains the transitive lifting operation.
  `LawfulMonadLiftT` further asserts that lifting commutes with `pure` and `bind`:
```
monadLift (pure a) = pure a
monadLift (ma >>= f) = monadLift ma >>= monadLift ∘ f
```
-/
class LawfulMonadLiftT (m : Type u → Type v) (n : Type u → Type w) [Monad m] [Monad n]
    [inst : MonadLiftT m n] : Prop where
  /-- Lifting preserves `pure` -/
  monadLift_pure {α : Type u} (a : α) : inst.monadLift (pure a) = pure a
  /-- Lifting preserves `bind` -/
  monadLift_bind {α β : Type u} (ma : m α) (f : α → m β) :
    inst.monadLift (ma >>= f) = monadLift ma >>= (fun x => monadLift (f x))

export LawfulMonadLiftT (monadLift_pure monadLift_bind)

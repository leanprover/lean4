`PSum α β`, or `α ⊕' β`, is the disjoint union of types `α` and `β`.
It differs from `α ⊕ β` in that it allows `α` and `β` to have arbitrary sorts
`Sort u` and `Sort v`, instead of restricting to `Type u` and `Type v`. This means
that it can be used in situations where one side is a proposition, like `True ⊕' Nat`.

The reason this is not the default is that this type lives in the universe `Sort (max 1 u v)`,
which can cause problems for universe level unification,
because the equation `max 1 u v = ?u + 1` has no solution in level arithmetic.
`PSum` is usually only used in automation that constructs sums of arbitrary types.

`PSigma β`, also denoted `Σ' a : α, β a` or `(a : α) ×' β a`, is the type of dependent pairs
whose first component is `a : α` and whose second component is `b : β a`
(so the type of the second component can depend on the value of the first component).
It differs from `Σ a : α, β a` in that it allows `α` and `β` to have arbitrary sorts
`Sort u` and `Sort v`, instead of restricting to `Type u` and `Type v`. This means
that it can be used in situations where one side is a proposition, like `(p : Nat) ×' p = p`.

The reason this is not the default is that this type lives in the universe `Sort (max 1 u v)`,
which can cause problems for universe level unification,
because the equation `max 1 u v = ?u + 1` has no solution in level arithmetic.
`PSigma` is usually only used in automation that constructs pairs of arbitrary types.

/--
Existential quantification. If `p : α → Prop` is a predicate, then `∃ x : α, p x`
asserts that there is some `x` of type `α` such that `p x` holds.
To create an existential proof, use the `exists` tactic,
or the anonymous constructor notation `⟨x, h⟩`.
To unpack an existential, use `cases h` where `h` is a proof of `∃ x : α, p x`,
or `let ⟨x, hx⟩ := h` where `.

Because Lean has proof irrelevance, any two proofs of an existential are
definitionally equal. One consequence of this is that it is impossible to recover the
witness of an existential from the mere fact of its existence.
For example, the following does not compile:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : Nat :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- fail, because the goal is `Nat : Type`
  x
```
The error message `recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop` means
that this only works when the current goal is another proposition:
```
example (h : ∃ x : Nat, x = x) : True :=
  let ⟨x, _⟩ := h  -- ok, because the goal is `True : Prop`
  trivial
```

Auxiliary type used to compile `for x in xs` notation.

This is the return value of the body of a `ForIn` call,
representing the body of a for loop. It can be:

* `.yield (a : α)`, meaning that we should continue the loop and `a` is the new state.
  `.yield` is produced by `continue` and reaching the bottom of the loop body.
* `.done (a : α)`, meaning that we should early-exit the loop with state `a`.
  `.done` is produced by calls to `break` or `return` in the loop,

`ForIn m ρ α` is the typeclass which supports `for x in xs` notation.
Here `xs : ρ` is the type of the collection to iterate over, `x : α`
is the element type which is made available inside the loop, and `m` is the monad
for the encompassing `do` block.
-/
class ForIn (m : Type u₁ → Type u₂) (ρ : Type u) (α : outParam (Type v)) where
  /-- `forIn x b f : m β` runs a for-loop in the monad `m` with additional state `β`.
  This traverses over the "contents" of `x`, and passes the elements `a : α` to
  `f : α → β → m (ForInStep β)`. `b : β` is the initial state, and the return value
  of `f` is the new state as well as a directive `.done` or `.yield`
  which indicates whether to abort early or continue iteration.

  The expression
  ```
  let mut b := ...
  for x in xs do
    b ← foo x b
  ```
  in a `do` block is syntactic sugar for:
  ```
  let b := ...
  let b ← forIn xs b (fun x b => do
    let b ← foo x b
    return .yield b)
  ```
  (Here `b` corresponds to the variables mutated in the loop.) -/

/--
Auxiliary type used to compile `do` notation. It is used when compiling a do block
nested inside a combinator like `tryCatch`. It encodes the possible ways the
block can exit:
* `pure (a : α) s` means that the block exited normally with return value `a`.
* `return (b : β) s` means that the block exited via a `return b` early-exit command.
* `break s` means that `break` was called, meaning that we should exit
  from the containing loop.
* `continue s` means that `continue` was called, meaning that we should continue
  to the next iteration of the containing loop.

All cases return a value `s : σ` which bundles all the mutable variables of the do-block.

`Prop` valued. It is mainly intended for programming applications.

An equivalence relation `~ : α → α → Prop` is a relation that is:

* reflexive: `x ~ x`
* symmetric: `x ~ y` implies `y ~ x`
* transitive: `x ~ y` and `y ~ z` implies `x ~ z`

Equality is an equivalence relation, and equivalence relations share many of
the properties of equality. In particular, `Quot α r` is most well behaved
when `r` is an equivalence relation, and in this case we use `Quotient` instead.

/-! # Propositional extensionality -/

/--
The axiom of **propositional extensionality**. It asserts that if propositions
`a` and `b` are logically equivalent (i.e. we can prove `a` from `b` and vice versa),
then `a` and `b` are *equal*, meaning that we can replace `a` with `b` in all
contexts.

For simple expressions like `a ∧ c ∨ d → e` we can prove that because all the logical
connectives respect logical equivalence, we can replace `a` with `b` in this expression
without using `propext`. However, for higher order expressions like `P a` where
`P : Prop → Prop` is unknown, or indeed for `a = b` itself, we cannot replace `a` with `b`
without an axiom which says exactly this.

This is a relatively uncontroversial axiom, which is intuitionistically valid.
It does however block computation when using `#reduce` to reduce proofs directly
(which is not recommended), meaning that canonicity,
the property that all closed terms of type `Nat` normalize to numerals,
fails to hold when this (or any) axiom is used:
```
set_option pp.proofs true

def foo : Nat := by
  have : (True → True) ↔ True := ⟨λ _ => trivial, λ _ _ => trivial⟩
  have := propext this ▸ (2 : Nat)
  exact this

#reduce foo
-- propext { mp := fun x x => True.intro, mpr := fun x => True.intro } ▸ 2

#eval foo -- 2
```
`#eval` can evaluate it to a numeral because the compiler erases casts and
does not evaluate proofs, so `propext`, whose return type is a proposition,
can never block it.

/-! # Quotients -/

namespace Quot
/--
The **quotient axiom**, or at least the nontrivial part of the quotient
axiomatization. Quotient types are introduced by the `init_quot` command
in `Init.Prelude` which introduces the axioms:

```
opaque Quot {α : Sort u} (r : α → α → Prop) : Sort u

opaque Quot.mk {α : Sort u} (r : α → α → Prop) (a : α) : Quot r

opaque Quot.lift {α : Sort u} {r : α → α → Prop} {β : Sort v} (f : α → β) :
  (∀ a b : α, r a b → f a = f b) → Quot r → β

opaque Quot.ind {α : Sort u} {r : α → α → Prop} {β : Quot r → Prop} :
  (∀ a : α, β (Quot.mk r a)) → ∀ q : Quot r, β q
```
All of these axioms are true if we assume `Quot α r = α` and `Quot.mk` and
`Quot.lift` are identity functions, so they do not add much. However this axiom
cannot be explained in that way (it is false for that interpretation), so the
real power of quotient types come from this axiom.

It says that the quotient by `r` maps elements which are related by `r` to equal
values in the quotient. Together with `Quot.lift` which says that functions
which respect `r` can be lifted to functions on the quotient, we can deduce that
`Quot α r` exactly consists of the equivalence classes with respect to `r`.

It is important to note that `r` need not be an equivalence relation in this axiom.
When `r` is not an equivalence relation, we are actually taking a quotient with
respect to the equivalence relation generated by `r`.

/-! # Function extensionality -/

/--
**Function extensionality** is the statement that if two functions take equal values
every point, then the functions themselves are equal: `(∀ x, f x = g x) → f = g`.
It is called "extensionality" because it talks about how to prove two objects are equal
based on the properties of the object (compare with set extensionality,
which is `(∀ x, x ∈ s ↔ x ∈ t) → s = t`).

This is often an axiom in dependent type theory systems, because it cannot be proved
from the core logic alone. However in lean's type theory this follows from the existence
of quotient types (note the `Quot.sound` in the proof, as well as the `show` line
which makes use of the definitional equality `Quot.lift f h (Quot.mk x) = f x`).

/-! # Squash -/

/--
`Squash α` is the quotient of `α` by the always true relation.
It is empty if `α` is empty, otherwise it is a singleton.
(Thus it is unconditionally a `Subsingleton`.)
It is the "universal `Subsingleton`" mapped from `α`.

It is similar to `Nonempty α`, which has the same properties, but unlike
`Nonempty` this is a `Type u`, that is, it is "data", and the compiler
represents an element of `Squash α` the same as `α` itself
(as compared to `Nonempty α`, whose elements are represented by a dummy value).

`Squash.lift` will extract a value in any subsingleton `β` from a function on `α`,
while `Nonempty.rec` can only do the same when `β` is a proposition.

/--
Depends on the correctness of the Lean compiler, interpreter, and all `[implemented_by ...]` and `[extern ...]` annotations.
-/
axiom trustCompiler : True

/--
When the kernel tries to reduce a term `Lean.reduceBool c`, it will invoke the Lean interpreter to evaluate `c`.
The kernel will not use the interpreter if `c` is not a constant.
This feature is useful for performing proofs by reflection.

Remark: the Lean frontend allows terms of the from `Lean.reduceBool t` where `t` is a term not containing
free variables. The frontend automatically declares a fresh auxiliary constant `c` and replaces the term with
`Lean.reduceBool c`. The main motivation is that the code for `t` will be pre-compiled.

Warning: by using this feature, the Lean compiler and interpreter become part of your trusted code base.
This is extra 30k lines of code. More importantly, you will probably not be able to check your development using
external type checkers (e.g., Trepplein) that do not implement this feature.
Keep in mind that if you are using Lean as programming language, you are already trusting the Lean compiler and interpreter.
So, you are mainly losing the capability of type checking your development using external checkers.

Recall that the compiler trusts the correctness of all `[implemented_by ...]` and `[extern ...]` annotations.
If an extern function is executed, then the trusted code base will also include the implementation of the associated
foreign function.

/--
Similar to `Lean.reduceBool` for closed `Nat` terms.

Remark: we do not have plans for supporting a generic `reduceValue {α} (a : α) : α := a`.
The main issue is that it is non-trivial to convert an arbitrary runtime object back into a Lean expression.
We believe `Lean.reduceBool` enables most interesting applications (e.g., proof by reflection).

The axiom `ofReduceBool` is used to perform proofs by reflection. See `reduceBool`.

This axiom is usually not used directly, because it has some syntactic restrictions.
Instead, the `native_decide` tactic can be used to prove any proposition whose
decidability instance can be evaluated to `true` using the lean compiler / interpreter.

This is a simp rule in Mathlib, but results in non-confluence that is difficult
to fix as decide distributes over propositions. As an example, observe that
`cond (decide (p ∧ q)) t f` could simplify to either:

* `if p ∧ q then t else f` via `Bool.cond_decide` or
* `cond (decide p && decide q) t f` via `Bool.decide_and`.

A possible approach to improve normalization between `cond` and `ite` would be
to completely simplify away `cond` by making `cond_eq_ite` a `simp` rule, but
that has not been taken since it could surprise users to migrate pure `Bool`
operations like `cond` to a mix of `Prop` and `Bool`.

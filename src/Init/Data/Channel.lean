Internal state of an `Channel`.

We maintain the invariant that at all times either `consumers` or `values` is empty.

/--
FIFO channel with unbounded buffer, where `recv?` returns a `Task`.

A channel can be closed.  Once it is closed, all `send`s are ignored, and
`recv?` returns `none` once the queue is empty.

Sends a message on an `Channel`.

This function does not block.

/--
Receives a message, without blocking.
The returned task waits for the message.
Every message is only received once.

Returns `none` if the channel is closed and the queue is empty.

Receives all currently queued messages from the channel.

Those messages are dequeued and will not be returned by `recv?`.

/--
Accesses synchronous (blocking) version of channel operations.

For example, `ch.sync.recv?` blocks until the next message,
and `for msg in ch.sync do ...` iterates synchronously over the channel.
These functions should only be used in dedicated threads.

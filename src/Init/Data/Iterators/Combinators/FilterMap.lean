# `filterMap`, `filter` and `map` combinators

This file provides iterator combinators for filtering and mapping.

* `IterM.filterMap` either modifies or drops each value based on an option-valued mapping function.
* `IterM.filter` drops some elements based on a predicate.
* `IterM.map` modifies each value based on a mapping function

Several variants of these combinators are provided:

* `M` suffix: Instead of a pure function, these variants take a monadic function. Given a suitable
  `MonadLiftT` instance, they also allow lifting the iterator to another monad first and then
  applying the mapping function in this monad.
* `WithPostcondition` suffix: These variants take a monadic function where the return type in the
  monad is a subtype. This variant is in rare cases necessary for the intrinsic verification of an
  iterator, and particularly for specialized termination proofs. If possible, avoid this.

-- We cannot use `inherit_doc` because the docstring for `IterM` states that a `MonadLiftT` instance
-- is needed.
/--
*Note: This is a very general combinator that requires an advanced understanding of monads,
dependent types and termination proofs. The variants `filterMap` and `filterMapM` are easier to use
and sufficient for most use cases.*

If `it` is an iterator, then `it.filterMapWithPostcondition f` is another iterator that applies a monadic
function `f` to all values emitted by `it`. `f` is expected to return an `Option` inside the monad.
If `f` returns `none`, then nothing is emitted; if it returns `some x`, then `x` is emitted.

`f` is expected to return `PostconditionT n (Option _)`, where `n` is an arbitrary monad.
The `PostconditionT` transformer allows the caller to intrinsically prove properties about
`f`'s return value in the monad `n`, enabling termination proofs depending on the specific behavior
of `f`.

**Marble diagram (without monadic effects):**

```text
it                                ---a --b--c --d-e--⊥
it.filterMapWithPostcondition     ---a'-----c'-------⊥
```

(given that `f a = pure (some a')`, `f c = pure (some c')` and `f b = f d = d e = pure none`)

**Termination properties:**

* `Finite` instance: only if `it` is finite
* `Productive` instance: only if `it` is finite

For certain mapping functions `f`, the resulting iterator will be finite (or productive) even though
no `Finite` (or `Productive`) instance is provided. For example, if `f` never returns `none`, then
this combinator will preserve productiveness. If `f` is an `ExceptT` monad and will always fail,
then `it.filterMapWithPostcondition` will be finite even if `it` isn't. In the first case, consider
using the `map`/`mapM`/`mapWithPostcondition` combinators instead, which provide more instances out of
the box.

In such situations, the missing instances can be proved manually if the postcondition bundled in
the `PostconditionT n` monad is strong enough. If `f` always returns `some _`, a suitable
postcondition is `fun x => x.isSome`; if `f` always fails, a suitable postcondition might be
`fun _ => False`.

**Performance:**

For each value emitted by the base iterator `it`, this combinator calls `f` and matches on the
returned `Option` value.

If `it` is an iterator, then `it.filterWithPostcondition f` is another iterator that applies a monadic
predicate `f` to all values emitted by `it` and emits them only if they are accepted by `f`.

`f` is expected to return `PostconditionT n (ULift Bool)`, where `n` is an arbitrary monad.
The `PostconditionT` transformer allows the caller to intrinsically prove properties about
`f`'s return value in the monad `n`, enabling termination proofs depending on the specific behavior
of `f`.

**Termination properties:**

* `Finite` instance: only if `it` is finite

For certain mapping functions `f`, the resulting iterator will be finite (or productive) even though

If `it` is an iterator, then `it.filterMapM f` is another iterator that applies a monadic
function `f` to all values emitted by `it`. `f` is expected to return an `Option` inside the monad.
If `f` returns `none`, then nothing is emitted; if it returns `some x`, then `x` is emitted.

If `f` is pure, then the simpler variant `it.filterMap` can be used instead.

If `it` is an iterator, then `it.filterM f` is another iterator that applies a monadic

If `it` is an iterator, then `it.mapM f` is another iterator that applies a monadic
function `f` to all values emitted by `it` and emits the result.

The base iterator `it` being monadic in `m`, `f` can return values in any monad `n` for which a
`MonadLiftT m n` instance is available.

If `f` is pure, then the simpler variant `it.map` can be used instead.

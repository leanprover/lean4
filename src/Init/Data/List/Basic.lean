# Basic operations on `List`.

We define
* basic operations on `List`,
* simp lemmas for applying the operations on `.nil` and `.cons` arguments
  (in the cases where the right hand side is simple to state; otherwise these are deferred to `Init.Data.List.Lemmas`),
* the minimal lemmas which are required for setting up `Init.Data.Array.Basic`.

In `Init.Data.List.Impl` we give tail-recursive versions of these operations
along with `@[csimp]` lemmas,

In `Init.Data.List.Lemmas` we develop the full API for these functions.

Recall that `length`, `get`, `set`, `foldl`, and `concat` have already been defined in `Init.Prelude`.

The operations are organized as follow:
* Equality: `beq`, `isEqv`.
* Lexicographic ordering: `lt`, `le`, and instances.
* Head and tail operators: `head`, `head?`, `headD?`, `tail`, `tail?`, `tailD`.
* Basic operations:
  `map`, `filter`, `filterMap`, `foldr`, `append`, `flatten`, `pure`, `flatMap`, `replicate`, and
  `reverse`.
* Additional functions defined in terms of these: `leftpad`, `rightPad`, and `reduceOption`.
* Operations using indexes: `mapIdx`.
* List membership: `isEmpty`, `elem`, `contains`, `mem` (and the `∈` notation),
  and decidability for predicates quantifying over membership in a `List`.
* Sublists: `take`, `drop`, `takeWhile`, `dropWhile`, `partition`, `dropLast`,
  `isPrefixOf`, `isPrefixOf?`, `isSuffixOf`, `isSuffixOf?`, `Subset`, `Sublist`,
  `rotateLeft` and `rotateRight`.
* Manipulating elements: `replace`, `modify`, `insert`, `insertIdx`, `erase`, `eraseP`, `eraseIdx`.
* Finding elements: `find?`, `findSome?`, `findIdx`, `indexOf`, `findIdx?`, `indexOf?`,
 `countP`, `count`, and `lookup`.
* Logic: `any`, `all`, `or`, and `and`.
* Zippers: `zipWith`, `zip`, `zipWithAll`, and `unzip`.
* Ranges and enumeration: `range`, `zipIdx`.
* Minima and maxima: `min?` and `max?`.
* Other functions: `intersperse`, `intercalate`, `eraseDups`, `eraseReps`, `span`, `splitBy`,
  `removeAll`
  (currently these functions are mostly only used in meta code,
  and do not have API suitable for verification).

Further operations are defined in `Init.Data.List.BasicAux`
(because they use `Array` in their implementations), namely:
* Variant getters: `get!`, `get?`, `getD`, `getLast`, `getLast!`, `getLast?`, and `getLastD`.
* Head and tail: `head!`, `tail!`.
* Other operations on sublists: `partitionMap`, `rotateLeft`, and `rotateRight`.

/--
Lexicographic ordering for lists with respect to an ordering of elements.

`as` is lexicographically smaller than `bs` if
 * `as` is empty and `bs` is non-empty, or
 * both `as` and `bs` are non-empty, and the head of `as` is less than the head of `bs` according to
   `r`, or
 * both `as` and `bs` are non-empty, their heads are equal, and the tail of `as` is less than the
   tail of `bs`.

Lexicographic ordering of lists with respect to an ordering on their elements.

`as < bs` if
 * `as` is empty and `bs` is non-empty, or
 * both `as` and `bs` are non-empty, and the head of `as` is less than the head of `bs`, or

/--
Non-strict ordering of lists with respect to a strict ordering of their elements.

`as ≤ bs` if `¬ bs < as`.

This relation can be treated as a lexicographic order if the underlying `LT α` instance is
well-behaved. In particular, it should be irreflexive, asymmetric, and antisymmetric. These
requirements are precisely formulated in `List.cons_le_cons_iff`. If these hold, then `as ≤ bs` if
and only if:
 * `as` is empty, or
 * both `as` and `bs` are non-empty, and the head of `as` is less than the head of `bs`, or
 * both `as` and `bs` are non-empty, their heads are equal, and the tail of `as` is less than or
   equal to the tail of `bs`.

/--
Compares lists lexicographically with respect to a comparison on their elements.

The lexicographic order with respect to `lt` is:
* `[].lex (b :: bs)` is `true`

* `(a :: as).lex (b :: bs)` is true if `lt a b` or `a == b` and `lex lt as bs` is true.

/--
Returns the first element in the list, if there is one. Returns `none` if the list is empty.

Use `List.headD` to provide a fallback value for empty lists, or `List.head!` to panic on empty

* `[1, 2, 5, 2, 7, 7].filter (fun _ => false) = []`

/-! ### filterMap -/

/--
Applies a function that returns an `Option` to each element of a list, collecting the non-`none`
values.

`O(|l|)`.

Example:

  if x > 2 then some (2 * x) else none
```
```output

/-! ### foldr -/

/--
Folds a function over a list from the right, accumulating a value starting with `init`. The
accumulated value is combined with the each element of the list in reverse order, using `f`.

`O(|l|)`. Replaced at runtime with `List.foldrTR`.

Examples:
 * `[a, b, c].foldr f init  = f a (f b (f c init))`
 * `[1, 2, 3].foldr (toString · ++ ·) "" = "123"`
 * `[1, 2, 3].foldr (s!"({·} {·})") "!" = "(1 (2 (3 !)))"`

/--
Reverses a list.

`O(|as|)`.

Because of the “functional but in place” optimization implemented by Lean's compiler, this function
does not allocate a new list when its reference to the input list is unshared: it simply walks the
linked list and reverses all the node pointers.

Examples:
* `[1, 2, 3, 4].reverse = [4, 3, 2, 1]`
* `[].reverse = []`
-/

  induction as generalizing bs cs with
  | nil => rfl
  | cons a as ih => simp [reverseAux, ih (bs := a::bs), ih (bs := [a])]

/-! ### append -/

/--
Appends two lists. Normally used via the `++` operator.

Appending lists takes time proportional to the length of the first list: `O(|xs|)`.

This is a tail-recursive version of `List.append`.

Examples:
  * `[1, 2, 3] ++ [4, 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
  * `[] ++ [4, 5] = [4, 5]`.
  * `[1, 2, 3] ++ [] = [1, 2, 3]`.

If the first list is a suffix of the second, returns the result of dropping the suffix from the
second.

In other words, `isSuffixOf? l₁ l₂` returns `some t` when `l₂ == t ++ l₁`.

Examples:
 * `[2, 3].isSuffixOf? [1, 2, 3] = some [1]`
 * `[2, 3].isSuffixOf? [1, 2, 3, 4] = none`

The first list is a suffix of the second.

`IsSuffix l₁ l₂`, written `l₁ <:+ l₂`, means that there exists some `t : List α` such that `l₂` has
the form `t ++ l₁`.

The function `List.isSuffixOf` is a Boolean equivalent.

/--
Splits a list at an index, resulting in the first `n` elements of `l` paired with the remaining
elements.

If `n` is greater than the length of `l`, then the resulting pair consists of `l` and the empty
list. `List.splitAt` is equivalent to a combination of `List.take` and `List.drop`, but it is more
efficient.

Examples:
* `["red", "green", "blue"].splitAt 2 = (["red", "green"], ["blue"])`
* `["red", "green", "blue"].splitAt 3 = (["red", "green", "blue], [])`
* `["red", "green", "blue"].splitAt 4 = (["red", "green", "blue], [])`

/-! ### rotateRight -/
/--
Rotates the elements of `xs` to the right, moving `i % xs.length` elements from the end of the list
to the start.

After rotation, the element at `xs[n]` is at index `(i + n) % l.length`. `O(|xs|)`.

Examples:
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].rotateRight 3 = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].rotateRight 5 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

section Pairwise

variable (R : α → α → Prop)

/--
Each element of a list is related to all later elements of the list by `R`.

`Pairwise R l` means that all the elements of `l` with earlier indexes are `R`-related to all the
elements with later indexes.

For example, `Pairwise (· ≠ ·) l` asserts that `l` has no duplicates, and `Pairwise (· < ·) l`
asserts that `l` is (strictly) sorted.

Examples:
 * `Pairwise (· < ·) [1, 2, 3] ↔ (1 < 2 ∧ 1 < 3) ∧ 2 < 3`
 * `Pairwise (· = ·) [1, 2, 3] = False`

  A nonempty list is pairwise related with `R` if the head is related to every element of the tail
  and the tail is itself pairwise related.

  That is, `a :: l` is `Pairwise R` if:
   * `R` relates `a` to every element of `l`
   * `l` is `Pairwise R`.

/-! ## Permutations -/

/-! ### Perm -/

/--
Two lists are permutations of each other if they contain the same elements, each occurring the same
number of times but not necessarily in the same order.

One list can be proven to be a permutation of another by showing how to transform one into the other
by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements.

`List.isPerm` is a Boolean equivalent of this relation.
-/
inductive Perm : List α → List α → Prop
  /-- The empty list is a permutation of the empty list: `[] ~ []`. -/
  | nil : Perm [] []
  /--
  If one list is a permutation of the other, adding the same element as the head of each yields
  lists that are permutations of each other: `l₁ ~ l₂ → x::l₁ ~ x::l₂`.
  -/
  | cons (x : α) {l₁ l₂ : List α} : Perm l₁ l₂ → Perm (x :: l₁) (x :: l₂)
  /--
  If two lists are identical except for having their first two elements swapped, then they are
  permutations of each other: `x::y::l ~ y::x::l`.
  -/
  | swap (x y : α) (l : List α) : Perm (y :: x :: l) (x :: y :: l)

/-! ### isPerm -/

/--
Returns `true` if `l₁` and `l₂` are permutations of each other. `O(|l₁| * |l₂|)`.

The relation `List.Perm` is a logical characterization of permutations. When the `BEq α` instance
corresponds to `DecidableEq α`, `isPerm l₁ l₂ ↔ l₁ ~ l₂` (use the theorem `isPerm_iff`).

/-! ## Additional functions -/

/-! ### leftpad -/

/--
Pads `l : List α` on the left with repeated occurrences of `a : α` until it is of length `n`. If `l`
already has at least `n` elements, it is returned unmodified.

This is a tail-recursive version of `List.leftpad`, used at runtime.

Examples:
 * `[1, 2, 3].leftPadTR 5 0 = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3]`
 * `["red", "green", "blue"].leftPadTR 4 "blank" = ["blank", "red", "green", "blue"]`
 * `["red", "green", "blue"].leftPadTR 3 "blank" = ["red", "green", "blue"]`
 * `["red", "green", "blue"].leftPadTR 1 "blank" = ["red", "green", "blue"]`

/-! ## Zippers -/

/-! ### unzip -/

/--
Separates a list of pairs into two lists that contain the respective first and second components.

`O(|l|)`. This is a tail-recursive version of `List.unzip` that's used at runtime.

Examples:
* `[("Monday", 1), ("Tuesday", 2)].unzipTR = (["Monday", "Tuesday"], [1, 2])`
* `[(x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), (x₃, y₃)].unzipTR = ([x₁, x₂, x₃], [y₁, y₂, y₃])`
* `([] : List (Nat × String)).unzipTR = (([], []) : List Nat × List String)`

/-! ## Ranges and enumeration -/

/-! ### range' -/

/--
Returns a list of the numbers with the given length `len`, starting at `start` and increasing by
`step` at each element.

In other words, `List.range'TR start len step` is `[start, start+step, ..., start+(len-1)*step]`.

This is a tail-recursive version of `List.range'`.

Examples:
 * `List.range'TR 0 3 (step := 1) = [0, 1, 2]`
 * `List.range'TR 0 3 (step := 2) = [0, 2, 4]`
 * `List.range'TR 0 4 (step := 2) = [0, 2, 4, 6]`
 * `List.range'TR 3 4 (step := 2) = [3, 5, 7, 9]`

/-! ## Other list operations -/

/-! ### intersperse -/

/--
Alternates the elements of `l` with `sep`.

`O(|l|)`.

This is a tail-recursive version of `List.intersperse`, used at runtime.

Examples:
* `List.intersperseTR "then" [] = []`
* `List.intersperseTR "then" ["walk"] = ["walk"]`
* `List.intersperseTR "then" ["walk", "run"] = ["walk", "then", "run"]`
* `List.intersperseTR "then" ["walk", "run", "rest"] = ["walk", "then", "run", "then", "rest"]`

Remark: we can define `mapM`, `mapM₂` and `forM` using `Applicative` instead of `Monad`.
Example:
```
def mapM {m : Type u → Type v} [Applicative m] {α : Type w} {β : Type u} (f : α → m β) : List α → m (List β)
  | []    => pure []
  | a::as => List.cons <$> (f a) <*> mapM as
```

However, we consider `f <$> a <*> b` an anti-idiom because the generated code
may produce unnecessary closure allocations.
Suppose `m` is a `Monad`, and it uses the default implementation for `Applicative.seq`.
Then, the compiler expands `f <$> a <*> b <*> c` into something equivalent to
```
(Functor.map f a >>= fun g_1 => Functor.map g_1 b) >>= fun g_2 => Functor.map g_2 c
```
In an ideal world, the compiler may eliminate the temporary closures `g_1` and `g_2` after it inlines
`Functor.map` and `Monad.bind`. However, this can easily fail. For example, suppose
`Functor.map f a >>= fun g_1 => Functor.map g_1 b` expanded into a match-expression.
This is not unreasonable and can happen in many different ways, e.g., we are using a monad that
may throw exceptions. Then, the compiler has to decide whether it will create a join-point for
the continuation of the match or float it. If the compiler decides to float, then it will
be able to eliminate the closures, but it may not be feasible since floating match expressions
may produce exponential blowup in the code size.

Finally, we rarely use `mapM` with something that is not a `Monad`.

Users that want to use `mapM` with `Applicative` should use `mapA` instead.

Applies the monadic action `f` to every element in the list, left-to-right, and returns the list of
results.

This implementation is tail recursive. `List.mapM'` is a a non-tail-recursive variant that may be
more convenient to reason about. `List.forM` is the variant that discards the results and
`List.mapA` is the variant that works with `Applicative`.

/--
Applies the applicative action `f` on every element in the list, left-to-right, and returns the list

If `m` is also a `Monad`, then using `mapM` can be more efficient.

See `List.forA` for the variant that discards the results. See `List.mapM` for the variant that
works with `Monad`.

This function is not tail-recursive, so it may fail with a stack overflow on long lists.

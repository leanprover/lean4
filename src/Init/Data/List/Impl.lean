## Tail recursive implementations for `List` definitions.

Many of the proofs require theorems about `Array`,
so these are in a separate file to minimize imports.

namespace List

/-! ## Basic `List` operations.

The following operations are already tail-recursive, and do not need `@[csimp]` replacements:
`get`, `foldl`, `beq`, `isEqv`, `reverse`, `elem` (and hence `contains`), `drop`, `dropWhile`,
`partition`, `isPrefixOf`, `isPrefixOf?`, `find?`, `findSome?`, `lookup`, `any` (and hence `or`),
`all` (and hence `and`) , `range`, `eraseDups`, `eraseReps`, `span`, `groupBy`.

The following operations are still missing `@[csimp]` replacements:
`concat`, `zipWithAll`.

The following operations are not recursive to begin with
(or are defined in terms of recursive primitives):
`isEmpty`, `isSuffixOf`, `isSuffixOf?`, `rotateLeft`, `rotateRight`, `insert`, `zip`, `enum`,
`minimum?`, `maximum?`, and `removeAll`.

The following operations are given `@[csimp]` replacements below:
`length`, `set`, `map`, `filter`, `filterMap`, `foldr`, `append`, `bind`, `join`, `replicate`,
`take`, `takeWhile`, `dropLast`, `replace`, `erase`, `eraseIdx`, `zipWith`, `unzip`, `iota`,
`enumFrom`, `intersperse`, and `intercalate`.

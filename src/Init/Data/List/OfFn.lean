/--
Creates a list by applying `f` to each potential index in order, starting at `0`.

Examples:
 * `List.ofFn (n := 3) toString = ["0", "1", "2"]`
 * `List.ofFn (fun i => #["red", "green", "blue"].get i.val i.isLt) = ["red", "green", "blue"]`

/--
Creates a list wrapped in a monad by applying the monadic function `f : Fin n → m α`
to each potential index in order, starting at `0`.

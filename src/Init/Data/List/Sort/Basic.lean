/--
Merges two lists, using `le` to select the first element of the resulting list if both are
non-empty.

If both input lists are sorted according to `le`, then the resulting list is also sorted according
to `le`. `O(min |l| |r|)`.

This implementation is not tail-recursive, but it is replaced at runtime by a proven-equivalent
tail-recursive merge.

/--
Split a list in two equal parts. If the length is odd, the first part will be one element longer.

This is an implementation detail of `mergeSort`.

/--
A stable merge sort.

This function is a simplified implementation that's designed to be easy to reason about, rather than
for efficiency. In particular, it uses the non-tail-recursive `List.merge` function and traverses
lists unnecessarily.

It is replaced at runtime by an efficient implementation that has been proven to be equivalent.

-- Because we want the sort to be stable, it is essential that we split the list in two contiguous
-- sublists.

/--
Given an ordering relation `le : α → α → Bool`,
construct the lexicographic ordering on `α × Nat`.
which first compares the first components using `le`,
but if these are equivalent (in the sense `le a.2 b.2 && le b.2 a.2`)
then compares the second components using `≤`.

This function is only used in stating the stability properties of `mergeSort`.

  if le a.1 b.1 then if le b.1 a.1 then a.2 ≤ b.2 else true else false

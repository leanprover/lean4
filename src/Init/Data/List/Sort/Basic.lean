# Definition of `merge` and `mergeSort`.

These definitions are intended for verification purposes,
and are replaced at runtime by efficient versions in `Init.Data.List.Sort.Impl`.

`O(min |l| |r|)`. Merge two lists using `le` as a switch.

This version is not tail-recursive,
but it is replaced at runtime by `mergeTR` using a `@[csimp]` lemma.

/--
Split a list in two equal parts. If the length is odd, the first part will be one element longer.

This is an implementation detail of `mergeSort`.

    { l : List α // l.length = (n+1)/2 } × { l : List α // l.length = n/2 } :=
  let r := splitAt ((n+1)/2) l.1

/--
Simplified implementation of stable merge sort.

This function is designed for reasoning about the algorithm, and is not efficient.
(It particular it uses the non tail-recursive `merge` function,
and so can not be run on large lists, but also makes unnecessary traversals of lists.)
It is replaced at runtime in the compiler by `mergeSortTR₂` using a `@[csimp]` lemma.

Because we want the sort to be stable,
it is essential that we split the list in two contiguous sublists.

    let lr := splitInTwo ⟨a :: b :: xs, rfl⟩

    have := by simpa using lr.1.2

/--
Given an ordering relation `le : α → α → Bool`,
construct the lexicographic ordering on `α × Nat`.
which first compares the first components using `le`,
but if these are equivalent (in the sense `le a.2 b.2 && le b.2 a.2`)
then compares the second components using `≤`.

This function is only used in stating the stability properties of `mergeSort`.

  if le a.1 b.1 then if le b.1 a.1 then a.2 ≤ b.2 else true else false

## Instance packages and factories for them

Instance packages are classes with the sole purpose to bundle together multiple smaller classes.
They should not be used as hypotheses, but they make it more convenient to define multiple instances
at once.

/--
Use this factory to conveniently define a preorder on a type `α` and all the associated operations
and instances given an `LE α` instance.

Creates a `PreorderPackage α` instance. Such an instance entails `LE α`, `LT α` and
`BEq α` instances as well as an `IsPreorder α` instance and `LawfulOrder*` instances proving the
compatibility of the operations with the preorder.

In the presence of `LE α`, `DecidableLE α`, `Refl (· ≤ ·)` and `Trans (· ≤ ·) (· ≤ ·) (· ≤ ·)`
instances, no arguments are required and the factory can be used as in this example:

```lean
public instance : PreorderPackage X := .ofLE X
```

If not all of these instances are available via typeclass synthesis, it is necessary to explicitly
provide some arguments:

```lean
public instance : PreorderPackage X := .ofLE X {
  le_refl := sorry
  le_trans := sorry }
```

It is also possible to do all of this by hand, without resorting to `PreorderPackage`. This can
be useful if, say, one wants to avoid specifying an `LT α` instance, which is not possible with
`PreorderPackage`.

**How the arguments are filled**

Lean tries to fill all of the fields of the `args : Packages.PreorderOfLEArgs α` parameter
automatically. If it fails, it is necessary to provide some of the fields manually.

* For the data-carrying typeclasses `LE`, `LT` and `BEq`, existing instances are always preferred.
  If no existing instances can be synthesized, it is attempted to derive an instance from the `LE`
  instance.
* Some proof obligations can be filled automatically if the data-carrying typeclasses have been
  derived from the `LE` instance. For example: If the `beq` field is omitted and no `BEq α` instance
  can be synthesized, it is derived from the `LE α` instance. In this case, `beq_iff_le_and_ge` can
  be omitted because Lean can infer that `BEq α` and `LE α` are compatible.
* Other proof obligations, namely `le_refl` and `le_trans`, can be omitted if `Refl` and `Trans`
  instances can be synthesized.

Use this factory to conveniently define a linear preorder on a type `α` and all the associated
operations and instances given an `Ord α` instance.

Creates a `LinearPreorderPackage α` instance. Such an instance entails `LE α`, `LT α`, `BEq α` and
`Ord α` instances as well as an `IsLinearPreorder α` instance and `LawfulOrder*` instances proving
the compatibility of the operations with the linear preorder.

In the presence of `Ord α` and `TransOrd α` instances, no arguments are required and the factory can
be used as in this example:

```lean
public instance : LinearPreorderPackage X := .ofOrd X
```

If not all of these instances are available via typeclass synthesis, it is necessary to explicitly
provide some arguments:

```lean
public instance : LinearPreorderPackage X := .ofOrd X {
  ord := sorry
  transOrd := sorry }
```

It is also possible to do all of this by hand, without resorting to `LinearPreorderPackage`. This
can be useful if, say, one wants to avoid specifying an `LT α` instance, which is not possible with
`LinearPreorderPackage`.

**How the arguments are filled**

Lean tries to fill all of the fields of the `args : Packages.LinearPreorderOfOrdArgs α` parameter
automatically. If it fails, it is necessary to provide some of the fields manually.

* For the data-carrying typeclasses `LE`, `LT`, `BEq` and `Ord`, existing instances are always
  preferred. If no existing instances can be synthesized, it is attempted to derive an instance from
  the `Ord` instance.
* Some proof obligations can be filled automatically if the data-carrying typeclasses have been
  derived from the `Ord` instance. For example: If the `beq` field is omitted and no `BEq α` instance
  can be synthesized, it is derived from the `Ord α` instance. In this case, `beq_iff`
  can be omitted because Lean can infer that `BEq α` and `Ord α` are compatible.
* Other proof obligations, for example `transOrd`, can be omitted if a matching instance can be
  synthesized.

Use this factory to conveniently define a linear order on a type `α` and all the associated
operations and instances given an `Ord α` instance.

Creates a `LinearOrderPackage α` instance. Such an instance entails `LE α`, `LT α`, `BEq α`,
`Ord α`, `Min α` and `Max α` instances as well as an `IsLinearOrder α` instance and `LawfulOrder*`
instances proving the compatibility of the operations with the linear order.

In the presence of `Ord α`, `TransOrd α` and `LawfulEqOrd α` instances, no arguments are required
and the factory can be used as in this
example:

```lean
public instance : LinearOrderPackage X := .ofLE X
```

If not all of these instances are available via typeclass synthesis, it is necessary to explicitly
provide some arguments:

```lean
public instance : LinearOrderPackage X := .ofLE X {
  transOrd := sorry
  eq_of_compare := sorry }
```

It is also possible to do all of this by hand, without resorting to `LinearOrderPackage`. This
can be useful if, say, one wants to avoid specifying an `LT α` instance, which is not possible with
`LinearOrderPackage`.

**How the arguments are filled**

Lean tries to fill all of the fields of the `args : Packages.LinearOrderOfLEArgs α` parameter
automatically. If it fails, it is necessary to provide some of the fields manually.

* For the data-carrying typeclasses `LE`, `LT`, `BEq`, `Ord`, `Min` and `Max`, existing instances
  are always preferred. If no existing instances can be synthesized, it is attempted to derive an
  instance from the `Ord` instance.
* Some proof obligations can be filled automatically if the data-carrying typeclasses have been
  derived from the `Ord` instance. For example: If the `beq` field is omitted and no `BEq α` instance
  can be synthesized, it is derived from the `LE α` instance. In this case, `beq_iff`
  can be omitted because Lean can infer that `BEq α` and `Ord α` are compatible.
* Other proof obligations, such as `transOrd`, can be omitted if matching instances can be
  synthesized.

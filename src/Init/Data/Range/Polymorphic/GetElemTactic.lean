This module contains an advanced `GetElem` tactic extension for polymorphic ranges.
While `Init.Data.Range.Polymorphic.Basic` already defines one, it only works in very
basic cases where the open upper bound of the range is exactly the size of the collection.

This tactic is using `omega` to be more powerful, but it needs special handling for `Vector`,
which is impossible in `Init.Data.Range.Polymorphic.Basic` for bootstrapping reasons.

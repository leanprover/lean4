/--
`l₁` is *not* lexicographically less than `l₂`
(which you might think of as "`l₂` is lexicographically greater than or equal to `l₁`"") if either
- `l₁` is pairwise equivalent under `· == ·` to `l₂` or
- there exists an index `i` such that
  - for all `j < i`, `l₁[j] == l₂[j]` and
  - `l₂[i] < l₁[i]`

This formulation requires that `==` and `lt` are compatible in the following senses:
- `==` is symmetric
  (we unnecessarily further assume it is transitive, to make use of the existing typeclasses)
- `lt` is irreflexive with respect to `==` (i.e. if `x == y` then `lt x y = false`
- `lt` is asymmetric  (i.e. `lt x y = true → lt y x = false`)
- `lt` is antisymmetric with respect to `==` (i.e. `lt x y = false → lt y x = false → x == y`)

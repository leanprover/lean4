The flag `(iff := false)` prevents `ext` from generating an `ext_iff` lemma.

syntax extIff := atomic("(" &"iff" " := " &"false" ")")

/--
The flag `(flat := false)` causes `ext` to not flatten parents' fields when generating an `ext` lemma.
-/
syntax extFlat := atomic("(" &"flat" " := " &"false" ")")

/--
Registers an extensionality theorem.

* When `@[ext]` is applied to a theorem, the theorem is registered for the `ext` tactic, and it generates an "`ext_iff`" theorem.
  The name of the theorem is from adding the suffix `_iff` to the theorem name.

* When `@[ext]` is applied to a structure, it generates an `.ext` theorem and applies the `@[ext]` attribute to it.
  The result is an `.ext` and an `.ext_iff` theorem with the `.ext` theorem registered for the `ext` tactic.

* An optional natural number argument, e.g. `@[ext 9000]`, specifies a priority for the `ext` lemma.
  Higher-priority lemmas are chosen first, and the default is `1000`.

* The flag `@[ext (iff := false)]` disables generating an `ext_iff` theorem.

* The flag `@[ext (flat := false)]` causes generated structure extensionality theorems to show inherited fields based on their representation,
  rather than flattening the parents' fields into the lemma's equality hypotheses.

namespace Elab.Tactic.Ext

/--
Applies extensionality lemmas that are registered with the `@[ext]` attribute.
* `ext pat*` applies extensionality theorems as much as possible,
  using the patterns `pat*` to introduce the variables in extensionality theorems using `rintro`.
  For example, the patterns are used to name the variables introduced by lemmas such as `funext`.
* Without patterns,`ext` applies extensionality lemmas as much
  as possible but introduces anonymous hypotheses whenever needed.
* `ext pat* : n` applies ext theorems only up to depth `n`.

The `ext1 pat*` tactic is like `ext pat*` except that it only applies a single extensionality theorem.

Unused patterns will generate warning.
Patterns that don't match the variables will typically result in the introduction of anonymous hypotheses.

`ext1 pat*` is like `ext pat*` except that it only applies a single extensionality theorem rather
than recursively applying as many extensionality theorems as possible.

The `pat*` patterns are processed using the `rintro` tactic.
If no patterns are supplied, then variables are introduced anonymously using the `intros` tactic.

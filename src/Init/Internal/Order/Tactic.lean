`monotonicity` performs one compositional step solving `monotone` goals,
using lemma tagged with `@[partial_fixpoint_monotone]`.

This tactic is mostly used internally by lean in `partial_fixpoint` definitions, but
can be useful on its own for debugging or when proving new `@[partial_fixpoint_monotone]` lemmas.

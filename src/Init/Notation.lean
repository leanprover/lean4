namespace Lean

/--
Auxiliary type used to represent syntax categories. We mainly use auxiliary
definitions with this type to attach doc strings to syntax categories.
-/
structure Parser.Category

namespace Parser.Category

/-- `command` is the syntax category for things that appear at the top level
of a lean file. For example, `def foo := 1` is a `command`, as is
`namespace Foo` and `end Foo`. Commands generally have an effect on the state of
adding something to the environment (like a new definition), as well as
commands like `variable` which modify future commands within a scope. -/
def command : Category := {}

/-- `term` is the builtin syntax category for terms. A term denotes an expression
in lean's type theory, for example `2 + 2` is a term. The difference between
`Term` and `Expr` is that the former is a kind of syntax, while the latter is
the result of elaboration. For example `by simp` is also a `Term`, but it elaborates
to different `Expr`s depending on the context. -/
def term : Category := {}

/-- `tactic` is the builtin syntax category for tactics. These appear after
`by` in proofs, and they are programs that take in the proof context
(the hypotheses in scope plus the type of the term to synthesize) and construct
a term of the expected type. For example, `simp` is a tactic, used in:
```
example : 2 + 2 = 4 := by simp
```
-/
def tactic : Category := {}

/-- `doElem` is a builtin syntax category for elements that can appear in the `do` notation.
For example, `let x ← e` is a `doElem`, and a `do` block consists of a list of `doElem`s. -/
def doElem : Category := {}

/-- `level` is a builtin syntax category for universe levels.
This is the `u` in `Sort u`: it can contain `max` and `imax`, addition with
constants, and variables. -/
def level : Category := {}

/-- `attr` is a builtin syntax category for attributes.
Declarations can be annotated with attributes using the `@[...]` notation. -/
def attr : Category := {}

/-- `stx` is a builtin syntax category for syntax. This is the abbreviated
parser notation used inside `syntax` and `macro` declarations. -/
def stx : Category := {}

/-- `prio` is a builtin syntax category for priorities.
Priorities are used in many different attributes.
Higher numbers denote higher priority, and for example typeclass search will
try high priority instances before low priority.
In addition to literals like `37`, you can also use `low`, `mid`, `high`, as well as
add and subtract priorities. -/
def prio : Category := {}

/-- `prec` is a builtin syntax category for precedences. A precedence is a value
that expresses how tightly a piece of syntax binds: for example `1 + 2 * 3` is
parsed as `1 + (2 * 3)` because `*` has a higher pr0ecedence than `+`.
Higher numbers denote higher precedence.
In addition to literals like `37`, there are some special named priorities:
* `arg` for the precedence of function arguments
* `max` for the highest precedence used in term parsers (not actually the maximum possible value)
* `lead` for the precedence of terms not supposed to be used as arguments
and you can also add and subtract precedences. -/
def prec : Category := {}

/--
`p+` is shorthand for `many1(p)`. It uses parser `p` 1 or more times, and produces a
`nullNode` containing the array of parsed results. This parser has arity 1.

If `p` has arity more than 1, it is auto-grouped in the items generated by the parser.
-/
syntax:arg stx:max "+" : stx

/--
`p*` is shorthand for `many(p)`. It uses parser `p` 0 or more times, and produces a
`nullNode` containing the array of parsed results. This parser has arity 1.

If `p` has arity more than 1, it is auto-grouped in the items generated by the parser.
-/
syntax:arg stx:max "*" : stx

/--
`(p)?` is shorthand for `optional(p)`. It uses parser `p` 0 or 1 times, and produces a
`nullNode` containing the array of parsed results. This parser has arity 1.

`p` is allowed to have arity n > 1 (in which case the node will have either 0 or n children),
but if it has arity 0 then the result will be ambiguous.

Because `?` is an identifier character, `ident?` will not work as intended.
You have to write either `ident ?` or `(ident)?` for it to parse as the `?` combinator
applied to the `ident` parser.
-/
syntax:arg stx:max "?" : stx

/--
`p1 <|> p2` is shorthand for `orelse(p1, p2)`, and parses either `p1` or `p2`.
It does not backtrack, meaning that if `p1` consumes at least one token then
`p2` will not be tried. Therefore, the parsers should all differ in their first
token. The `atomic(p)` parser combinator can be used to locally backtrack a parser.
(For full backtracking, consider using extensible syntax classes instead.)

On success, if the inner parser does not generate exactly one node, it will be
automatically wrapped in a `group` node, so the result will always be arity 1.

The `<|>` combinator does not generate a node of its own, and in particular
does not tag the inner parsers to distinguish them, which can present a problem
when reconstructing the parse. A well formed `<|>` parser should use disjoint
node kinds for `p1` and `p2`.

`p,*` is shorthand for `sepBy(p, ",")`. It parses 0 or more occurrences of
`p` separated by `,`, that is: `empty | p | p,p | p,p,p | ...`.

It produces a `nullNode` containing a `SepArray` with the interleaved parser
results. It has arity 1, and auto-groups its component parser if needed.

otherwise parses nothing. It has arity 0.

/--
The `nat_lit n` macro constructs "raw numeric literals". This corresponds to the
`Expr.lit (.natVal n)` constructor in the `Expr` data type.

Normally, when you write a numeral like `#check 37`, the parser turns this into
an application of `OfNat.ofNat` to the raw literal `37` to cast it into the
target type, even if this type is `Nat` (so the cast is the identity function).
But sometimes it is necessary to talk about the raw numeral directly,
especially when proving properties about the `ofNat` function itself.

  It has better support for applying coercions. For example, suppose we have `binrel% Eq n i` where `n : Nat` and

which uses let bindings as intermediates as in
`let left := [d, e, f]; a :: b :: c :: left` to avoid creating very deep expressions.

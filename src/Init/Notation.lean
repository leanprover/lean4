* `intro x y` introduces two hypotheses and names them. Individual hypotheses can be anonymized via `_`,

  intro (a, b)

`rewrite [e]` applies identity `e` as a rewrite rule to the target of the main goal.
If `e` is preceded by left arrow (`←` or `<-`), the rewrite is applied in the reverse direction.
If `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems associated with `e` are used. This provides a convenient way to unfold `e`.
- `rewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]` applies the given rules sequentially.
- `rewrite [e] at l` rewrites `e` at location(s) `l`, where `l` is either `*` or a list of hypotheses in the local context. In the latter case, a turnstile `⊢` or `|-` can also be used, to signify the target of the goal.

The `injection` tactic is based on the fact that constructors of inductive data types are injections.
That means that if `c` is a constructor of an inductive datatype, and if `(c t₁)` and `(c t₂)` are two terms that are equal then  `t₁` and `t₂` are equal too.
If `q` is a proof of a statement of conclusion `t₁ = t₂`, then injection applies injectivity to derive the equality of all arguments of `t₁` and `t₂`
placed in the same positions. For example, from `(a::b) = (c::d)` we derive `a=c` and `b=d`. To use this tactic `t₁` and `t₂`
should be constructor applications of the same constructor.
Given `h : a::b = c::d`, the tactic `injection h` adds two new hypothesis with types `a = c` and `b = d` to the main goal.
The tactic `injection h with h₁ h₂` uses the names `h₁` and `h₂` to name the new hypotheses.

The `simp` tactic uses lemmas and hypotheses to simplify the main goal target or non-dependent hypotheses. It has many variants.
- `simp` simplifies the main goal target using lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]`.
- `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]` and the given `hᵢ`'s, where the `hᵢ`'s are expressions. If an `hᵢ` is a defined constant `f`, then the equational lemmas associated with `f` are used. This provides a convenient way to unfold `f`.
- `simp [*]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]` and all hypotheses.
- `simp only [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` is like `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` but does not use `[simp]` lemmas
- `simp [-id₁, ..., -idₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]`, but removes the ones named `idᵢ`.
- `simp at h₁ h₂ ... hₙ` simplifies the hypotheses `h₁ : T₁` ... `hₙ : Tₙ`. If the target or another hypothesis depends on `hᵢ`, a new simplified hypothesis `hᵢ` is introduced, but the old one remains in the local context.
- `simp at *` simplifies all the hypotheses and the target.
- `simp [*] at *` simplifies target and all (propositional) hypotheses using the other hypotheses.

`have h : t := e` adds the hypothesis `h : t` to the current goal if `e` a term of type `t`. If `t` is omitted, it will be inferred.
If `h` is omitted, the name `this` is used.
The variant `have pattern := e` is equivalent to `match e with | pattern => _`, and it is convenient for types that have only applicable constructor.

`let h : t := e` adds the hypothesis `h : t := e` to the current goal if `e` a term of type `t`.
If `t` is omitted, it will be inferred.
The variant `let pattern := e` is equivalent to `match e with | pattern => _`, and it is convenient for types that have only applicable constructor.
Example: given `h : p ∧ q ∧ r`, `let ⟨h₁, h₂, h₃⟩ := h` produces the hypotheses `h₁ : p`, `h₂ : q`, and `h₃ : r`.

Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type, `induction x` applies induction on `x` to the main goal,
producing one goal for each constructor of the inductive type, in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor
and an inductive hypothesis is added for each recursive argument to the constructor.
If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`, that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward,
so that the inductive hypothesis incorporates that hypothesis as well.
For example, given `n : Nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`, `induction n` produces one goal
with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`, and one goal with hypotheses `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and `ih₁ : P a → Q a` and target `Q (Nat.succ a)`.
Here the names `a` and `ih₁` are chosen automatically and are not accessible. You can use `with` to provide the variables names for each constructor.
- `induction e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable, generalizes `e` in the goal, and then performs induction on the resulting variable.
- `induction e using r` allows the user to specify the principle of induction that should be used. Here `r` should be a theorem whose result type must be of the form `C t`, where `C` is a bound variable and `t` is a (possibly empty) sequence of bound variables
- `induction e generalizing z₁ ... zₙ`, where `z₁ ... zₙ` are variables in the local context, generalizes over `z₁ ... zₙ` before applying the induction but then introduces them in each goal. In other words, the net effect is that each inductive hypothesis is generalized.
- Given `x : Nat`, `induction x with | zero => tac₁ | succ x' ih => tac₂` uses tactic `tac₁` for the `zero` case, and `tac₂` for the `succ` case.

Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type, `cases x` splits the main goal,
producing one goal for each constructor of the inductive type, in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor.
If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`, that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward,
so that the case split affects that hypothesis as well. `cases` detects unreachable cases and closes them automatically.
For example, given `n : Nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`, `cases n` produces one goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`,
and one goal with hypothesis `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and target `Q (Nat.succ a)`. Here the name `a` is chosen automatically and are not accessible. You can use `with` to provide the variables names for each constructor.
- `cases e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable, generalizes `e` in the goal, and then cases on the resulting variable.
- Given `as : List α`, `cases as with | nil => tac₁ | cons a as' => tac₂`, uses tactic `tac₁` for the `nil` case, and `tac₂` for the `cons` case, and `a` and `as'` are used as names for the new variables introduced.
- `cases h : e`, where `e` is a variable or an expression, performs cases on `e` as above, but also adds a hypothesis `h : e = ...` to each hypothesis, where `...` is the constructor instance for that particular case.

The tactic `specialize h a₁ ... aₙ` works on local hypothesis `h`.
The premises of this hypothesis, either universal quantifications or non-dependent implications,

The tactic adds a new hypothesis with the same name `h := h a₁ ... aₙ` and tries to clear the previous one.

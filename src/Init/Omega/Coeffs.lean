# `Coeffs` as a wrapper for `IntList`

Currently `omega` uses a dense representation for coefficients.
However, we can swap this out for a sparse representation.

This file sets up `Coeffs` as a type synonym for `IntList`,
and abbreviations for the functions in the `IntList` namespace which we need to use in the
`omega` algorithm.

There is an equivalent file setting up `Coeffs` as a type synonym for `AssocList Nat Int`,
currently in a private branch.
Not all the theorems about the algebraic operations on that representation have been proved yet.
When they are ready, we can replace the implementation in `omega` simply by importing
`Init.Omega.IntDict` instead of `Init.Omega.IntList`.

For small problems, the sparse representation is actually slightly slower,
so it is not urgent to make this replacement.

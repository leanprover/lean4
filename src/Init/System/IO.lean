Executes arbitrary side effects in a pure context. This a **dangerous** operation that can easily
undermine important assumptions about the meaning of Lean programs, and it should only be used with
great care and a thorough understanding of compiler internals, and even then only to implement
observationally pure operations.

This function is not a good way to convert a `BaseIO α` into an `α`. Instead, use
[`do`-notation](lean-manual://section/do-notation).

Because the resulting value is treated as a side-effect-free term, the compiler may re-order,
duplicate, or delete calls to this function. The side effect may even be hoisted into a constant,
causing the side effect to occur at initialization time, even if it would otherwise never be called.

input causes an end-of-file marker. Because the `Child` object has a reference to the standard
input, this operation is necessary in order to close the stream while the process is running (e.g.
to extract its exit code after calling `Child.wait`). Many processes do not terminate until their
standard input is exhausted.

POSIX-style file permissions.

The `FileRight` structure describes these permissions for a file's owner, members of it's designated
group, and all others.

Converts individual POSIX-style file permissions to their conventional three-bit representation.

This is the bitwise `or` of the following:
 * If the file can be read, `0x4`, otherwise `0`.
 * If the file can be written, `0x2`, otherwise `0`.
 * If the file can be executed, `0x1`, otherwise `0`.

Examples:
 * `{read := true : AccessRight}.flags = 4`
 * `{read := true, write := true : AccessRight}.flags = 6`
 * `{read := true, execution := true : AccessRight}.flags = 5`

Creates a stream from a mutable reference to a buffer.

The resulting stream simulates a file, mutating the contents of the reference in response to writes
and reading from it in response to reads. These streams can be used with `IO.withStdin`,
`IO.setStdin`, and the corresponding operators for standard output and standard error to redirect
input and output.

/--
Marks given value and its object graph closure as persistent. This will remove
reference counter updates but prevent the closure from being deallocated until
the end of the process! It can still be useful to do eagerly when the value
will be marked persistent later anyway and there is available time budget to
mark it now or it would be unnecessarily marked multi-threaded in between.

This function is only safe to use on objects (in the full closure) which are
not used concurrently or which are already persistent.

Discards the passed owned reference. This leads to `a` any any object reachable from it never being
freed. This can be a useful optimization for eliding deallocation time of big object graphs that are
kept alive close to the end of the process anyway (in which case calling `Runtime.markPersistent`
would be similarly costly to deallocation). It is still considered a safe operation as it cannot
lead to undefined behavior.

/--
Introduces one or more hypotheses, optionally naming and/or pattern-matching them.
For each hypothesis to be introduced, the remaining main goal's target type must
be a `let` or function type.

* `intro` by itself introduces one anonymous hypothesis, which can be accessed
  by e.g. `assumption`.
* `intro x y` introduces two hypotheses and names them. Individual hypotheses
  can be anonymized via `_`, or matched against a pattern:
  ```lean
  -- ... ⊢ α × β → ...
  intro (a, b)
  -- ..., a : α, b : β ⊢ ...
  ```
* Alternatively, `intro` can be combined with pattern matching much like `fun`:
  ```lean
  intro
  | n + 1, 0 => tac
  | ...
  ```
-/
syntax (name := intro) "intro" notFollowedBy("|") (ppSpace colGt term:max)* : tactic

/--
Introduces zero or more hypotheses, optionally naming them.

- `intros` is equivalent to repeatedly applying `intro`
  until the goal is not an obvious candidate for `intro`, which is to say
  that so long as the goal is a `let` or a pi type (e.g. an implication, function, or universal quantifier),
  the `intros` tactic will introduce an anonymous hypothesis.
  This tactic does not unfold definitions.

- `intros x y ...` is equivalent to `intro x y ...`,
  introducing hypotheses for each supplied argument and unfolding definitions as necessary.
  Each argument can be either an identifier or a `_`.
  An identifier indicates a name to use for the corresponding introduced hypothesis,
  and a `_` indicates that the hypotheses should be introduced anonymously.

## Examples

Basic properties:
```lean
def AllEven (f : Nat → Nat) := ∀ n, f n % 2 = 0

-- Introduces the two obvious hypotheses automatically
example : ∀ (f : Nat → Nat), AllEven f → AllEven (fun k => f (k + 1)) := by
  intros
  /- Tactic state
     f✝ : Nat → Nat
     a✝ : AllEven f✝
     ⊢ AllEven fun k => f✝ (k + 1) -/
  sorry

-- Introduces exactly two hypotheses, naming only the first
example : ∀ (f : Nat → Nat), AllEven f → AllEven (fun k => f (k + 1)) := by
  intros g _
  /- Tactic state
     g : Nat → Nat
     a✝ : AllEven g
     ⊢ AllEven fun k => g (k + 1) -/
  sorry

-- Introduces exactly three hypotheses, which requires unfolding `AllEven`
example : ∀ (f : Nat → Nat), AllEven f → AllEven (fun k => f (k + 1)) := by
  intros f h n
  /- Tactic state
     f : Nat → Nat
     h : AllEven f
     n : Nat
     ⊢ (fun k => f (k + 1)) n % 2 = 0 -/
  apply h
```

     a✝ : q

Changes the goal to `False`, retaining as much information as possible:

* If the goal is `False`, do nothing.
* If the goal is an implication or a function type, introduce the argument and restart.
  (In particular, if the goal is `x ≠ y`, introduce `x = y`.)
* Otherwise, for a propositional goal `P`, replace it with `¬ ¬ P`
  (attempting to find a `Decidable` instance, but otherwise falling back to working classically)
  and introduce `¬ P`.

`apply e` tries to match the current goal against the conclusion of `e`'s type.
If it succeeds, then the tactic returns as many subgoals as the number of premises that
have not been fixed by type inference or type class resolution.
Non-dependent premises are added before dependent ones.

The `apply` tactic uses higher-order pattern matching, type class resolution,
and first-order unification with dependent types.

The `sorry` tactic closes the goal using `sorryAx`. This is intended for stubbing out incomplete

you can double check if a theorem depends on `sorry` by using

`rewrite [e]` applies identity `e` as a rewrite rule to the target of the main goal.
If `e` is preceded by left arrow (`←` or `<-`), the rewrite is applied in the reverse direction.
If `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems associated with `e` are used.
This provides a convenient way to unfold `e`.
- `rewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]` applies the given rules sequentially.
- `rewrite [e] at l` rewrites `e` at location(s) `l`, where `l` is either `*` or a
  list of hypotheses in the local context. In the latter case, a turnstile `⊢` or `|-`
  can also be used, to signify the target of the goal.

Using `rw (occs := .pos L) [e]`,
where `L : List Nat`, you can control which "occurrences" are rewritten.
(This option applies to each rule, so usually this will only be used with a single rule.)
Occurrences count from `1`.
At each allowed occurrence, arguments of the rewrite rule `e` may be instantiated,
restricting which later rewrites can be found.
(Disallowed occurrences do not result in instantiation.)
`(occs := .neg L)` allows skipping specified occurrences.

/--
The `injection` tactic is based on the fact that constructors of inductive data
types are injections.
That means that if `c` is a constructor of an inductive datatype, and if `(c t₁)`
and `(c t₂)` are two terms that are equal then  `t₁` and `t₂` are equal too.
If `q` is a proof of a statement of conclusion `t₁ = t₂`, then injection applies
injectivity to derive the equality of all arguments of `t₁` and `t₂` placed in
the same positions. For example, from `(a::b) = (c::d)` we derive `a=c` and `b=d`.
To use this tactic `t₁` and `t₂` should be constructor applications of the same constructor.
Given `h : a::b = c::d`, the tactic `injection h` adds two new hypothesis with types
`a = c` and `b = d` to the main goal.
The tactic `injection h with h₁ h₂` uses the names `h₁` and `h₂` to name the new hypotheses.

The `simp` tactic uses lemmas and hypotheses to simplify the main goal target or
non-dependent hypotheses. It has many variants:
- `simp` simplifies the main goal target using lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]`.
- `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged
  with the attribute `[simp]` and the given `hᵢ`'s, where the `hᵢ`'s are expressions.-
- If an `hᵢ` is a defined constant `f`, then `f` is unfolded. If `f` has equational lemmas associated
  with it (and is not a projection or a `reducible` definition), these are used to rewrite with `f`.
- `simp [*]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged with the
  attribute `[simp]` and all hypotheses.
- `simp only [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` is like `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` but does not use `[simp]` lemmas.
- `simp [-id₁, ..., -idₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged
  with the attribute `[simp]`, but removes the ones named `idᵢ`.
- `simp at h₁ h₂ ... hₙ` simplifies the hypotheses `h₁ : T₁` ... `hₙ : Tₙ`. If
  the target or another hypothesis depends on `hᵢ`, a new simplified hypothesis
  `hᵢ` is introduced, but the old one remains in the local context.
- `simp at *` simplifies all the hypotheses and the target.
- `simp [*] at *` simplifies target and all (propositional) hypotheses using the
  other hypotheses.

This is a "finishing" tactic modification of `simp`. It has two forms.

* `simpa [rules, ⋯] using e` will simplify the goal and the type of
  `e` using `rules`, then try to close the goal using `e`.

  Simplifying the type of `e` makes it more likely to match the goal
  (which has also been simplified). This construction also tends to be
  more robust under changes to the simp lemma set.

* `simpa [rules, ⋯]` will simplify the goal and the type of a
  hypothesis `this` if present in the context, then try to close the goal using
  the `assumption` tactic.

* `unfold id at h` unfolds at the hypothesis `h`.

Definitions can be either global or local definitions.

For non-recursive global definitions, this tactic is identical to `delta`.
For recursive global definitions, it uses the "unfolding lemma" `id.eq_def`,
which is generated for each recursive definition, to unfold according to the recursive definition given by the user.
Only one level of unfolding is performed, in contrast to `simp only [id]`, which unfolds definition `id` recursively.

The `have` tactic is for adding hypotheses to the local context of the main goal.
* `have h : t := e` adds the hypothesis `h : t` if `e` is a term of type `t`.
* `have h := e` uses the type of `e` for `t`.
* `have : t := e` and `have := e` use `this` for the name of the hypothesis.
* `have pat := e` for a pattern `pat` is equivalent to `match e with | pat => _`,
  where `_` stands for the tactics that follow this one.
  It is convenient for types that have only one applicable constructor.
  For example, given `h : p ∧ q ∧ r`, `have ⟨h₁, h₂, h₃⟩ := h` produces the
  hypotheses `h₁ : p`, `h₂ : q`, and `h₃ : r`.

Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type,
`induction x` applies induction on `x` to the main goal,
producing one goal for each constructor of the inductive type,
in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor
and an inductive hypothesis is added for each recursive argument to the constructor.
If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`,
that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward,
so that the inductive hypothesis incorporates that hypothesis as well.

For example, given `n : Nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`,
`induction n` produces one goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`,
and one goal with hypotheses `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and `ih₁ : P a → Q a` and target `Q (Nat.succ a)`.
Here the names `a` and `ih₁` are chosen automatically and are not accessible.
You can use `with` to provide the variables names for each constructor.
- `induction e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable,
  generalizes `e` in the goal, and then performs induction on the resulting variable.
- `induction e using r` allows the user to specify the principle of induction that should be used.
  Here `r` should be a term whose result type must be of the form `C t`,
  where `C` is a bound variable and `t` is a (possibly empty) sequence of bound variables
- `induction e generalizing z₁ ... zₙ`, where `z₁ ... zₙ` are variables in the local context,
  generalizes over `z₁ ... zₙ` before applying the induction but then introduces them in each goal.
  In other words, the net effect is that each inductive hypothesis is generalized.
- Given `x : Nat`, `induction x with | zero => tac₁ | succ x' ih => tac₂`
  uses tactic `tac₁` for the `zero` case, and `tac₂` for the `succ` case.

/--
Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type,
`cases x` splits the main goal, producing one goal for each constructor of the
inductive type, in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor.
If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`,
that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward,
so that the case split affects that hypothesis as well.
`cases` detects unreachable cases and closes them automatically.

For example, given `n : Nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`,
`cases n` produces one goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`,
and one goal with hypothesis `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and target `Q (Nat.succ a)`.
Here the name `a` is chosen automatically and is not accessible.
You can use `with` to provide the variables names for each constructor.
- `cases e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable, generalizes `e` in the goal,
  and then cases on the resulting variable.
- Given `as : List α`, `cases as with | nil => tac₁ | cons a as' => tac₂`,
  uses tactic `tac₁` for the `nil` case, and `tac₂` for the `cons` case,
  and `a` and `as'` are used as names for the new variables introduced.
- `cases h : e`, where `e` is a variable or an expression,
  performs cases on `e` as above, but also adds a hypothesis `h : e = ...` to each hypothesis,
  where `...` is the constructor instance for that particular case.

one goal with hypothesis `n = 0` and target `Q`, and a second goal with hypothesis
`¬n = 0` and target `R`.  Note that the introduced hypothesis is unnamed, and is commonly

/--
`decide` attempts to prove the main goal (with target type `p`) by synthesizing an instance of `Decidable p`
and then reducing that instance to evaluate the truth value of `p`.
If it reduces to `isTrue h`, then `h` is a proof of `p` that closes the goal.

The target is not allowed to contain local variables or metavariables.
If there are local variables, you can first try using the `revert` tactic with these local variables to move them into the target,
or you can use the `+revert` option, described below.

Options:
- `decide +revert` begins by reverting local variables that the target depends on,
  after cleaning up the local context of irrelevant variables.
  A variable is *relevant* if it appears in the target, if it appears in a relevant variable,
  or if it is a proposition that refers to a relevant variable.
- `decide +kernel` uses kernel for reduction instead of the elaborator.
  It has two key properties: (1) since it uses the kernel, it ignores transparency and can unfold everything,
  and (2) it reduces the `Decidable` instance only once instead of twice.
- `decide +native` uses the native code compiler (`#eval`) to evaluate the `Decidable` instance,
  admitting the result via the `Lean.ofReduceBool` axiom.
  This can be significantly more efficient than using reduction, but it is at the cost of increasing the size
  of the trusted code base.
  Namely, it depends on the correctness of the Lean compiler and all definitions with an `@[implemented_by]` attribute.
  Like with `+kernel`, the `Decidable` instance is evaluated only once.

Limitation: In the default mode or `+kernel` mode, since `decide` uses reduction to evaluate the term,
`Decidable` instances defined by well-founded recursion might not work because evaluating them requires reducing proofs.
Reduction can also get stuck on `Decidable` instances with `Eq.rec` terms.
These can appear in instances defined using tactics (such as `rw` and `simp`).
To avoid this, create such instances using definitions such as `decidable_of_iff` instead.

## Examples

Proving inequalities:
```lean
example : 2 + 2 ≠ 5 := by decide
```

Trying to prove a false proposition:
```lean
example : 1 ≠ 1 := by decide
/-
tactic 'decide' proved that the proposition

```

Trying to prove a proposition whose `Decidable` instance fails to reduce
```lean

  unknownProp

## Properties and relations

It will attempt to prove a goal of type `p` by synthesizing an instance
of `Decidable p` and then evaluating it to `isTrue ..`. Unlike `decide`, this
uses `#eval` to evaluate the decidability instance.

This should be used with care because it adds the entire lean compiler to the trusted
part, and the axiom `Lean.ofReduceBool` will show up in `#print axioms` for theorems using
this method or anything that transitively depends on them. Nevertheless, because it is
compiled, this can be significantly more efficient than using `decide`, and for very
large computations this is one way to run external programs and trust the result.

The `omega` tactic, for resolving integer and natural linear arithmetic problems.

It is not yet a full decision procedure (no "dark" or "grey" shadows),
but should be effective on many problems.

We handle hypotheses of the form `x = y`, `x < y`, `x ≤ y`, and `k ∣ x` for `x y` in `Nat` or `Int`
(and `k` a literal), along with negations of these statements.

We decompose the sides of the inequalities as linear combinations of atoms.

If we encounter `x / k` or `x % k` for literal integers `k` we introduce new auxiliary variables
and the relevant inequalities.

On the first pass, we do not perform case splits on natural subtraction.
If `omega` fails, we recursively perform a case split on
a natural subtraction appearing in a hypothesis, and try again.

The options
```
omega +splitDisjunctions +splitNatSub +splitNatAbs +splitMinMax
```
can be used to:
* `splitDisjunctions`: split any disjunctions found in the context,
  if the problem is not otherwise solvable.
* `splitNatSub`: for each appearance of `((a - b : Nat) : Int)`, split on `a ≤ b` if necessary.
* `splitNatAbs`: for each appearance of `Int.natAbs a`, split on `0 ≤ a` if necessary.
* `splitMinMax`: for each occurrence of `min a b`, split on `min a b = a ∨ min a b = b`
Currently, all of these are on by default.

/-- `assumption_mod_cast` is a variant of `assumption` that solves the goal
using a hypothesis. Unlike `assumption`, it first pre-processes the goal and
each hypothesis to move casts as far outwards as possible, so it can be used
in more situations.

Concretely, it runs `norm_cast` on the goal. For each local hypothesis `h`, it also
normalizes `h` with `norm_cast` and tries to use that to close the goal. -/
macro "assumption_mod_cast" : tactic => `(tactic| norm_cast0 at * <;> assumption)

/--
The `norm_cast` family of tactics is used to normalize certain coercions (*casts*) in expressions.
- `norm_cast` normalizes casts in the target.
- `norm_cast at h` normalizes casts in hypothesis `h`.

The tactic is basically a version of `simp` with a specific set of lemmas to move casts
upwards in the expression.
Therefore even in situations where non-terminal `simp` calls are discouraged (because of fragility),
`norm_cast` is considered to be safe.
It also has special handling of numerals.

For instance, given an assumption
```lean
a b : ℤ
h : ↑a + ↑b < (10 : ℚ)
```
writing `norm_cast at h` will turn `h` into
```lean
h : a + b < 10
```

There are also variants of basic tactics that use `norm_cast` to normalize expressions during
their operation, to make them more flexible about the expressions they accept
(we say that it is a tactic *modulo* the effects of `norm_cast`):
- `exact_mod_cast` for `exact` and `apply_mod_cast` for `apply`.
  Writing `exact_mod_cast h` and `apply_mod_cast h` will normalize casts
  in the goal and `h` before using `exact h` or `apply h`.
- `rw_mod_cast` for `rw`. It applies `norm_cast` between rewrites.
- `assumption_mod_cast` for `assumption`.
  This is effectively `norm_cast at *; assumption`, but more efficient.
  It normalizes casts in the goal and, for every hypothesis `h` in the context,
  it will try to normalize casts in `h` and use `exact h`.

See also `push_cast`, which moves casts inwards rather than lifting them outwards.

`ac_nf` normalizes equalities up to application of an associative and commutative operator.
- `ac_nf` normalizes all hypotheses and the goal target of the goal.
- `ac_nf at l` normalizes at location(s) `l`, where `l` is either `*` or a
  list of hypotheses in the local context. In the latter case, a turnstile `⊢` or `|-`
  can also be used, to signify the target of the goal.

`push_cast` rewrites the goal to move certain coercions (*casts*) inward, toward the leaf nodes.
This uses `norm_cast` lemmas in the forward direction.
For example, `↑(a + b)` will be written to `↑a + ↑b`.
- `push_cast` moves casts inward in the goal.
- `push_cast at h` moves casts inward in the hypothesis `h`.
It can be used with extra simp lemmas with, for example, `push_cast [Int.add_zero]`.

Example:
```lean
example (a b : Nat)
    (h1 : ((a + b : Nat) : Int) = 10)
    (h2 : ((a + b + 0 : Nat) : Int) = 10) :

`solve_by_elim` calls `apply` on the main goal to find an assumption whose head matches
and then repeatedly calls `apply` on the generated subgoals until no subgoals remain,
performing at most `maxDepth` (defaults to 6) recursive steps.

`solve_by_elim` discharges the current goal or fails.

`solve_by_elim` performs backtracking if subgoals can not be solved.

By default, the assumptions passed to `apply` are the local context, `rfl`, `trivial`,
`congrFun` and `congrArg`.

The assumptions can be modified with similar syntax as for `simp`:
* `solve_by_elim [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` also applies the given expressions.
* `solve_by_elim only [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` does not include the local context,
  `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun`, or `congrArg` unless they are explicitly included.
* `solve_by_elim [-h₁, ... -hₙ]` removes the given local hypotheses.
* `solve_by_elim using [a₁, ...]` uses all lemmas which have been labelled
  with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created using `register_label_attr`).

`solve_by_elim*` tries to solve all goals together, using backtracking if a solution for one goal
makes other goals impossible.
(Adding or removing local hypotheses may not be well-behaved when starting with multiple goals.)

Optional arguments passed via a configuration argument as `solve_by_elim (config := { ... })`
- `maxDepth`: number of attempts at discharging generated subgoals
- `symm`: adds all hypotheses derived by `symm` (defaults to `true`).
- `exfalso`: allow calling `exfalso` and trying again if `solve_by_elim` fails
  (defaults to `true`).
- `transparency`: change the transparency mode when calling `apply`. Defaults to `.default`,
  but it is often useful to change to `.reducible`,
  so semireducible definitions will not be unfolded when trying to apply a lemma.

See also the doc-comment for `Lean.Meta.Tactic.Backtrack.BacktrackConfig` for the options
`proc`, `suspend`, and `discharge` which allow further customization of `solve_by_elim`.
Both `apply_assumption` and `apply_rules` are implemented via these hooks.

`apply_assumption` looks for an assumption of the form `... → ∀ _, ... → head`
where `head` matches the current goal.

You can specify additional rules to apply using `apply_assumption [...]`.
By default `apply_assumption` will also try `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun`, and `congrArg`.
If you don't want these, or don't want to use all hypotheses, use `apply_assumption only [...]`.
You can use `apply_assumption [-h]` to omit a local hypothesis.
You can use `apply_assumption using [a₁, ...]` to use all lemmas which have been labelled
with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created using `register_label_attr`).

`apply_assumption` will use consequences of local hypotheses obtained via `symm`.

If `apply_assumption` fails, it will call `exfalso` and try again.
Thus if there is an assumption of the form `P → ¬ Q`, the new tactic state
will have two goals, `P` and `Q`.

You can pass a further configuration via the syntax `apply_rules (config := {...}) lemmas`.
The options supported are the same as for `solve_by_elim` (and include all the options for `apply`).

`apply_rules [l₁, l₂, ...]` tries to solve the main goal by iteratively
applying the list of lemmas `[l₁, l₂, ...]` or by applying a local hypothesis.
If `apply` generates new goals, `apply_rules` iteratively tries to solve those goals.
You can use `apply_rules [-h]` to omit a local hypothesis.

`apply_rules` will also use `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun` and `congrArg`.
These can be disabled, as can local hypotheses, by using `apply_rules only [...]`.

You can use `apply_rules using [a₁, ...]` to use all lemmas which have been labelled
with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created using `register_label_attr`).

You can pass a further configuration via the syntax `apply_rules (config := {...})`.
The options supported are the same as for `solve_by_elim` (and include all the options for `apply`).

`apply_rules` will try calling `symm` on hypotheses and `exfalso` on the goal as needed.
This can be disabled with `apply_rules (config := {symm := false, exfalso := false})`.

You can bound the iteration depth using the syntax `apply_rules (config := {maxDepth := n})`.

Unlike `solve_by_elim`, `apply_rules` does not perform backtracking, and greedily applies
a lemma from the list until it gets stuck.

namespace Attr
/--
Theorems tagged with the `simp` attribute are used by the simplifier
(i.e., the `simp` tactic, and its variants) to simplify expressions occurring in your goals.
We call theorems tagged with the `simp` attribute "simp theorems" or "simp lemmas".
Lean maintains a database/index containing all active simp theorems.
Here is an example of a simp theorem.
```lean
@[simp] theorem ne_eq (a b : α) : (a ≠ b) = Not (a = b) := rfl
```
This simp theorem instructs the simplifier to replace instances of the term
`a ≠ b` (e.g. `x + 0 ≠ y`) with `Not (a = b)` (e.g., `Not (x + 0 = y)`).
The simplifier applies simp theorems in one direction only:
if `A = B` is a simp theorem, then `simp` replaces `A`s with `B`s,
but it doesn't replace `B`s with `A`s. Hence a simp theorem should have the
property that its right-hand side is "simpler" than its left-hand side.
In particular, `=` and `↔` should not be viewed as symmetric operators in this situation.
The following would be a terrible simp theorem (if it were even allowed):
```lean
@[simp] lemma mul_right_inv_bad (a : G) : 1 = a * a⁻¹ := ...
```
Replacing 1 with a * a⁻¹ is not a sensible default direction to travel.
Even worse would be a theorem that causes expressions to grow without bound,
causing simp to loop forever.

By default the simplifier applies `simp` theorems to an expression `e`
after its sub-expressions have been simplified.
We say it performs a bottom-up simplification.
You can instruct the simplifier to apply a theorem before its sub-expressions
have been simplified by using the modifier `↓`. Here is an example
```lean
@[simp↓] theorem not_and_eq (p q : Prop) : (¬ (p ∧ q)) = (¬p ∨ ¬q) :=
```

You can instruct the simplifier to rewrite the lemma from right-to-left:
```lean
attribute @[simp ←] and_assoc
```

When multiple simp theorems are applicable, the simplifier uses the one with highest priority.
The equational theorems of function are applied at very low priority (100 and below).
If there are several with the same priority, it is uses the "most recent one". Example:
```lean
@[simp high] theorem cond_true (a b : α) : cond true a b = a := rfl
@[simp low+1] theorem or_true (p : Prop) : (p ∨ True) = True :=
  propext <| Iff.intro (fun _ => trivial) (fun _ => Or.inr trivial)
@[simp 100] theorem ite_self {d : Decidable c} (a : α) : ite c a a = a := by

/--
The `norm_cast` attribute should be given to lemmas that describe the
behaviour of a coercion with respect to an operator, a relation, or a particular
function.

It only concerns equality or iff lemmas involving `↑`, `⇑` and `↥`, describing the behavior of
the coercion functions.
It does not apply to the explicit functions that define the coercions.

Examples:
```lean
@[norm_cast] theorem coe_nat_inj' {m n : ℕ} : (↑m : ℤ) = ↑n ↔ m = n

@[norm_cast] theorem coe_int_denom (n : ℤ) : (n : ℚ).denom = 1

@[norm_cast] theorem cast_id : ∀ n : ℚ, ↑n = n

@[norm_cast] theorem coe_nat_add (m n : ℕ) : (↑(m + n) : ℤ) = ↑m + ↑n

@[norm_cast] theorem cast_coe_nat (n : ℕ) : ((n : ℤ) : α) = n

@[norm_cast] theorem cast_one : ((1 : ℚ) : α) = 1
```

Lemmas tagged with `@[norm_cast]` are classified into three categories: `move`, `elim`, and
`squash`. They are classified roughly as follows:

* elim lemma:   LHS has 0 head coes and ≥ 1 internal coe
* move lemma:   LHS has 1 head coe and 0 internal coes,    RHS has 0 head coes and ≥ 1 internal coes
* squash lemma: LHS has ≥ 1 head coes and 0 internal coes, RHS has fewer head coes

`norm_cast` uses `move` and `elim` lemmas to factor coercions toward the root of an expression
and to cancel them from both sides of an equation or relation. It uses `squash` lemmas to clean
up the result.

It is typically not necessary to specify these categories, as `norm_cast` lemmas are
automatically classified by default. The automatic classification can be overridden by
giving an optional `elim`, `move`, or `squash` parameter to the attribute.

```lean
@[simp, norm_cast elim] lemma nat_cast_re (n : ℕ) : (n : ℂ).re = n := by
  rw [← of_real_nat_cast, of_real_re]
```

Don't do this unless you understand what you are doing.

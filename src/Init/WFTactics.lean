This is primarily intended for internal use in `decreasing_tactic`. -/

/-- Extensible helper tactic for `decreasing_tactic`. This handles the "base case"
reasoning after applying lexicographic order lemmas.
It can be extended by adding more macro definitions, e.g.
```
macro_rules | `(tactic| decreasing_trivial) => `(tactic| linarith)
```

/-- Constructs a proof of decreasing along a well founded relation, by applying
lexicographic order lemmas and using `ts` to solve the base case. If it fails,
it prints a message to help the user diagnose an ill-founded recursive definition. -/

  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the remaining goals
  - Use `termination_by` to specify a different well-founded relation
  - Use `decreasing_by` to specify your own tactic for discharging this kind of goal"))

/-- `decreasing_tactic` is called by default on well-founded recursions in order
to synthesize a proof that recursive calls decrease along the selected
well founded relation. It can be locally overridden by using `decreasing_by tac`
on the recursive definition, and it can also be globally extended by adding
more definitions for `decreasing_tactic` (or `decreasing_trivial`,
which this tactic calls). -/

/--
Unfold definitions commonly used in well founded relation definitions.

Since Lean 4.12, Lean unfolds these definitions automatically before presenting the goal to the
user, and this tactic should no longer be necessary. Calls to `simp_wf` can be removed or replaced
by plain calls to `simp`.
-/
macro "simp_wf" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| try simp +unfoldPartialApp +zetaDelta [invImage, InvImage, Prod.lex, sizeOfWFRel, measure, Nat.lt_wfRel, WellFoundedRelation.rel])

/--
This tactic is used internally by lean before presenting the proof obligations from a well-founded
definition to the user via `decreasing_by`. It is not necessary to use this tactic manually.
-/
macro "clean_wf" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| simp +unfoldPartialApp +zetaDelta -failIfUnchanged
     only [invImage, InvImage, Prod.lex, sizeOfWFRel, measure, Nat.lt_wfRel,
           WellFoundedRelation.rel, sizeOf_nat, reduceCtorEq])

/-- Extensible helper tactic for `decreasing_tactic`. This handles the "base case"
reasoning after applying lexicographic order lemmas.
It can be extended by adding more macro definitions, e.g.
```
macro_rules | `(tactic| decreasing_trivial) => `(tactic| linarith)
```
-/
syntax "decreasing_trivial" : tactic

macro_rules | `(tactic| decreasing_trivial) => `(tactic| (simp +arith -failIfUnchanged) <;> done)
macro_rules | `(tactic| decreasing_trivial) => `(tactic| omega)
macro_rules | `(tactic| decreasing_trivial) => `(tactic| assumption)

/--
Variant of `decreasing_trivial` that does not use `omega`, intended to be used in core modules
before `omega` is available.
-/
syntax "decreasing_trivial_pre_omega" : tactic
macro_rules | `(tactic| decreasing_trivial_pre_omega) => `(tactic| apply Nat.sub_succ_lt_self; assumption) -- a - (i+1) < a - i if i < a
macro_rules | `(tactic| decreasing_trivial_pre_omega) => `(tactic| apply Nat.pred_lt_of_lt; assumption) -- i-1 < i if j < i
macro_rules | `(tactic| decreasing_trivial_pre_omega) => `(tactic| apply Nat.pred_lt; assumption)  -- i-1 < i if i â‰  0


/-- Constructs a proof of decreasing along a well founded relation, by simplifying, then applying
lexicographic order lemmas and finally using `ts` to solve the base case. If it fails,
it prints a message to help the user diagnose an ill-founded recursive definition. -/
macro "decreasing_with " ts:tacticSeq : tactic =>
 `(tactic|
   (clean_wf -- remove after next stage0 update
    try simp
    repeat (first | apply Prod.Lex.right | apply Prod.Lex.left)
    repeat (first | apply PSigma.Lex.right | apply PSigma.Lex.left)
    first
    | done
    | $ts
    | fail "failed to prove termination, possible solutions:
  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the remaining goals
  - Use `termination_by` to specify a different well-founded relation
  - Use `decreasing_by` to specify your own tactic for discharging this kind of goal"))

/-- `decreasing_tactic` is called by default on well-founded recursions in order
to synthesize a proof that recursive calls decrease along the selected
well founded relation. It can be locally overridden by using `decreasing_by tac`
on the recursive definition, and it can also be globally extended by adding
more definitions for `decreasing_tactic` (or `decreasing_trivial`,
which this tactic calls). -/
macro "decreasing_tactic" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| decreasing_with first | decreasing_trivial | subst_vars; decreasing_trivial)

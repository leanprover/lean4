/--
Instructs the compiler to use a different function as the implementation of a function. With the
exception of tactics that call native code such as `native_decide`, the kernel and type checking
are unaffected. When this attribute is used on a function, the function is not compiled and all
compiler-related attributes (e.g. `noncomputable`, `@[inline]`) are ignored. Calls to this
function are replaced by calls to its implementation.

The most common use cases of `@[implemented_by]` are to provide an efficient unsafe implementation
and to make an unsafe function accessible in safe code through an opaque function:

```
unsafe def testEqImpl (as bs : Array Nat) : Bool :=
  ptrEq as bs || as == bs

@[implemented_by testEqImpl]
def testEq (as bs : Array Nat) : Bool :=
  as == bs

unsafe def printAddrImpl {α : Type u} (x : α) : IO Unit :=
  IO.println s!"Address: {ptrAddrUnsafe x}"

@[implemented_by printAddrImpl]
opaque printAddr {α : Type u} (x : α) : IO Unit
```

The provided implementation is not checked to be equivalent to the original definition. This makes
it possible to prove `False` with `native_decide` using incorrect implementations. For a safer
variant of this attribute that however doesn't work for unsafe implementations, see `@[csimp]`,
which requires a proof that the two functions are equal.

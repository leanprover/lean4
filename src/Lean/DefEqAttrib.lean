There are defeq theorems that only hold at transparency `.all`, but also others that hold
(from the kernel's point of view) but where the defeq checker here will run out of cycles.

So we try the more careful first.

Marks the theorem as a definitional equality.

The theorem must be an equality that holds by `rfl`. This allows `dsimp` to use this theorem
when rewriting.

A theorem with with a definition that is (syntactically) `:= rfl` is implicitly marked `@[defeq]`.
To avoid this behavior, write `:= (rfl)` instead.

The attribute should be given before a `@[simp]` attribute to have effect.

When using the module system, an exported theorem can only be `@[defeq]` if all definitions that
need to be unfolded to prove the theorem are exported and exposed.

For automatically generated theorems (equational theorems etc.), we want to set the `defeq` attribute
if the proof is `rfl`, essentially reproducing the behavior before the introduction of the `defeq`
attribute. This function infers the `defeq` attribute based on the declaration value.

     As a side-effect, this creates matchers. Here we capture all these side-effects, because
     the construction rolls back any changes done to the environment and the side-effects
     need to be replayed. -/

  Return true iff `e` contains an application `recFnName .. t ..` where the term `t` is
  the argument we are trying to recurse on, and it contains loose bound variables.

  We use this test to decide whether we should process a matcher-application as a regular
  application or not. That is, whether we should push the `below` argument should be affected by the matcher or not.
  If `e` does not contain an application of the form `recFnName .. t ..`, then we know
  the recursion doesn't depend on any pattern variable in this matcher.

/--
Lets say we have `n` mutually recursive functions whose recursive arguments are from a group
of `m` mutually inductive data types. This mapping does not have to be one-to-one: for one type
there can be zero, one or more functions. We use the logic in the `FunPacker` modules to combine
the bodies (and motives) of multiple such functions.

Therefore we have to take the `n` functions, group them by their recursive argument's type,
and for each such type, keep track of the order of the functions.

We represent these positions as an `Array (Array Nat)`. We have that

* `positions.size = indInfo.numTypeFormers`
* `positions.flatten` is a permutation of `[0:n]`, so each of the `n` functions has exactly one
  position, and each position refers to one of the `n` functions.
* if `k ∈ positions[i]` then the recursive argument of function `k` is has type `indInfo.all[i]`
  (or corresponding nested inductive type)

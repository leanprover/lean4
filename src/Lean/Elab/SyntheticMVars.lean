  Try to synthesize `mvarId` by starting using a default instance with the give privority.
  This method succeeds only if the metavariable of fully synthesized.

  Remark: In the past, we would return a list of pending TC problems, but this was problematic since
  a default instance may create subproblems that cannot be solved.

  Remark: The new approach also has limitations because other pending metavariables are not taken into account
  while backtraking. That is, we fail to synthesize `mvarId` because we reach subproblems that are stuck,
  but we could "unstuck" them if we tried to solve other pending metavariables. Considering all pending metavariables
  into a single backtracking search seems to be too expensive, and potentially generate incomprehensible error messages.
  This is particularly true if we consider pending metavariables for "postponed" elaboration steps.
  Here is an example that demonstrate this issue. The example considers we are using the old `binrel%` elaborator which was
  disconnected from `binop%`.
  ```
  example (a : Int) (b c : Nat) : a = ↑b - ↑c := sorry
  ```
  We have two pending coercions for the `↑` and `HSub ?m.220 ?m.221 ?m.222`.
  When we did not use a backtracking search here, then the homogenous default instance for `HSub`.
  ```
  instance [Sub α] : HSub α α α where
  ```
  would be applied first, and would propagate the expected type `Int` to the pending coercions which would now be unblocked.

  Instead of performing a backtracking search that considers all pending metavariables, we improved the `binrel%` elaborator.

  Try to solve postponed universe constraints, and throws an exception if there are stuck constraints.

  Remark: in previous versions, each `isDefEq u v` invocation would fail if there
  were pending universe level constraints. With this old approach, we were not able
  to process
  ```
  Functor.map Prod.fst (x s)
  ```
  because after elaborating `Prod.fst` and trying to ensure its type
  match the expected one, we would be stuck at the universe constraint:
  ```
  u =?= max u ?v

  Another benefit of using `withoutPostponingUniverseConstraints` is better error messages. Instead
  of getting a mysterious type mismatch constraint, we get a list of
  universe contraints the system is stuck at.

    /-
    TODO: consider using `runPendingTacticsAt` at `mvarId` local context and target type.
    Issue #1380 demonstrates that the goal may still contain pending metavariables.
    It happens in the following scenario we have a term `foo A (by tac)` where `A` has been postponed
    and contains nested `by ...` terms. The pending metavar list contains two metavariables: ?m1 (for `A`) and
    `?m2` (for `by tac`). When `A` is resumed, it creates a new metavariable `?m3` for the nested `by ...` term in `A`.
    `?m3` is after `?m2` in the to-do list. Then, we execute `by tac` for synthesizing `?m2`, but its type depends on
    `?m3`. We have considered putting `?m3` at `?m2` place in the to-do list, but this is not super robust.
    The ideal solution is to make sure a tactic "resolves" all pending metavariables nested in their local contex and target type
    before starting tactic execution. The procedure would be a generalization of `runPendingTacticsAt`. We can try to combine
    it with `instantiateMVarDeclMVars` to make sure we do not perform two traversals.
    Regarding issue #1380, we addressed the issue by avoiding the elaboration postponement step. However, the same issue can happen
    in more complicated scenarios.

/--
Collect unassigned metavariables at `e` that have associated tactic blocks, and then execute them using `runTactic`.
We use this method at the `match .. with` elaborator when it cannot be postponed anymore, but it is still waiting
the result of a tactic block.

# Implementation of the `change` tactic

/--
Elaborates the pattern `p` and ensures that it is defeq to `e`.
Emulates `(show p from ?m : e)`, returning the type of `?m`, but `e` and `p` do not need to be types.
Unlike `(show p from ?m : e)`, this can assign synthetic opaque metavariables appearing in `p`.

      Sometimes isDefEq can fail due to postponed elaboration problems.
      We synthesize pending synthetic mvars while allowing typeclass instances to be postponed,
      which might enable solving for them with an additional `isDefEq`.

/-- `change` can be used to replace the main goal or its hypotheses with
different, yet definitionally equal, goal or hypotheses.

For example, if `n : Nat` and the current goal is `⊢ n + 2 = 2`, then
```lean
change _ + 1 = _
```
changes the goal to `⊢ n + 1 + 1 = 2`.

The tactic also applies to hypotheses. If `h : n + 2 = 2` and `h' : n + 3 = 4`
are hypotheses, then
```lean
change _ + 1 = _ at h h'
```
changes their types to be `h : n + 1 + 1 = 2` and `h' : n + 2 + 1 = 4`.

Change is like `refine` in that every placeholder needs to be solved for by unification,
but using named placeholders or `?_` results in `change` to creating new goals.

The tactic `show e` is interchangeable with `change e`, where the pattern `e` is applied to
the main goal. -/

Implementation of the `exact?` tactic.

* `ref` contains the input syntax and is used for locations in error reporting.
* `required` contains an optional list of terms that should be used in closing the goal.
* `requireClose` indicates if the goal must be closed.
  It is `true` for `exact?` and `false` for `apply?`.

  Executes `tac` in `savedState` (then restores the current state). Used to ensure that a suggested
  tactic is valid.

  Remark: we don't merely elaborate the proof term's syntax because it may successfully round-trip
  (d)elaboration but still produce an invalid tactic (see the example in #5407).

  Suggests using the value of `goal` as a proof term if the corresponding tactic is valid at
  `origGoal`, or else informs the user that a proof exists but is not syntactically valid.

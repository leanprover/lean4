Implementation of the `exact?` tactic.

* `ref` contains the input syntax and is used for locations in error reporting.
* `required` contains an optional list of terms that should be used in closing the goal.
* `requireClose` indicates if the goal must be closed.
  It is `true` for `exact?` and `false` for `apply?`.

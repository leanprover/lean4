Runs the given `atLocal` and `atTarget` methods on each of the locations selected by the given `loc`.
* If `loc` is a list of locations, runs at each specified hypothesis (and finally the goal if `⊢` is included),
  and fails if any of the tactic applications fail.
* If `loc` is `*`, runs at the target first and then the hypotheses in reverse order.
  If `atTarget` closes the main goal, `withLocation` does not run `atLocal`.
  If all tactic applications fail, `withLocation` with call `failed` with the main goal mvar.

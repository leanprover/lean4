# `rfl` tactic extension for reflexive relations

This extends the `rfl` tactic so that it works on reflexive relations other than `=`,
provided the reflexivity lemma has been marked as `@[refl]`.

namespace Lean.Elab.Tactic.Rfl

/--
This tactic applies to a goal whose target has the form `x ~ x`, where `~` is a reflexive
relation, that is, a relation which has a reflexive lemma tagged with the attribute [refl].

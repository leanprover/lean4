/--
Pair of (optional) old snapshot task usable for incremental reuse and new snapshot promise for
incremental reporting. Inside the elaborator, we build snapshots by carrying such bundles and then
checking if we can reuse `old?` if set or else redoing the corresponding elaboration step. In either
case, we derive new bundles for nested snapshots, if any, and finally `resolve` `new` to the result.

Note that failing to `resolve` a created promise will block the language server indefinitely!
Corresponding `IO.Promise.new` calls should come with a "definitely resolved in ..." comment
explaining how this is avoided in each case.

In the future, the 1-element history `old?` may be replaced with a global cache indexed by strong
hashes but the promise will still need to be passed through the elaborator.
-/
structure SnapshotBundle (α : Type) where
  /--
  Snapshot task of corresponding elaboration in previous document version if any.  Should be set to
  `none` as soon as reuse can be ruled out.

  Promise of snapshot value for the current document. When resolved, the language server will
  report its result even before the current elaborator invocation has finished.
  -/

/--
  Tree of snapshots where each snapshot comes with an array of asynchronous further subtrees. Used
  for asynchronously collecting information about the entirety of snapshots in the language server.
  The involved tasks may form a DAG on the `Task` dependency level but this is not captured by this
  data structure. -/

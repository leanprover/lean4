/-!
This exports a predicate for checking whether a name should be made
visible in auto-completion and other tactics that suggest names to
insert into Lean code.

The `exact?` tactic is an example of a tactic that benefits from this
functionality.  `exact?` finds lemmas in the environment to use to
prove a theorem, but it needs to avoid inserting references to theorems
with unstable names such as auxiliary lemmas that could change with
minor unintentional modifications to definitions.

It uses a blacklist environment extension to enable names in an
environment to be specifically hidden.

/--
Checks whether a given name is internal due to something other than `_private`.
Correctly deals with names like `_private.<SomeNamespace>.0.<SomeType>._sizeOf_1` in a private type
`SomeType`, which `n.isInternal && !isPrivateName n` does not.

Return true if name is blacklisted for completion purposes.

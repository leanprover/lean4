# `backtrack`

A meta-tactic for running backtracking search, given a non-deterministic tactic
`alternatives : MVarId → Nondet MetaM (List MVarId)`.

`backtrack alternatives goals` will recursively try to solve all goals in `goals`,
and the subgoals generated, backtracking as necessary.

In its default behaviour, it will either solve all goals, or fail.
A customisable `suspend` hook in `BacktrackConfig` allows suspend a goal (or subgoal),
so that it will be returned instead of processed further.
Other hooks `proc` and `discharge` (described in `BacktrackConfig`) allow running other
tactics before `alternatives`, or if all search branches from a given goal fail.

Currently only `solveByElim` is implemented in terms of `backtrack`.

Configuration structure to control the behaviour of `backtrack`:
* control the maximum depth and behaviour (fail or return subgoals) at the maximum depth,
* and hooks allowing
  * modifying intermediate goals before running the external tactic,
  * 'suspending' goals, returning them in the result, and
  * discharging subgoals if the external tactic fails.

  /-- An arbitrary procedure which can be used to modify the list of goals
  before each attempt to generate alternatives.
  Called as `proc goals curr`, where `goals` are the original goals for `backtracking`,
  and `curr` are the current goals.
  Returning `some l` will replace the current goals with `l` and recurse
  (consuming one step of maximum depth).
  Returning `none` will proceed to generating alternative without changing goals.
  Failure will cause backtracking.

  but return `g` as a new subgoal. (defaults to `false`) -/
  suspend : MVarId → MetaM Bool := fun _ => pure false
  /-- `discharge g` is called on goals for which there were no alternatives.
  If `none` we return `g` as a new subgoal.
  If `some l`, we replace `g` by `l` in the list of active goals, and recurse.
  If failure, we backtrack. (defaults to failure) -/

  If we solve any "independent" goals, don't fail.

/--
Attempts to solve the `goals`, by recursively calling `next` on each
subgoal that appears with a callback to reenter backtracking search.

Further flow control options are available via the `Config` argument.

Returns a list of subgoals which were "suspended" via the `suspend` or
`discharge` hooks in `Config`. In the default configuration, `backtrack`
will either return an empty list or fail.

/--
Erases a name marked `ext` by adding it to the state's `erased` field and
removing it from the state's list of `Entry`s.

This is triggered by `attribute [-ext] name`.

def ExtTheorems.eraseCore (d : ExtTheorems) (declName : Name) : ExtTheorems :=
 { d with erased := d.erased.insert declName }

/--
Erases a name marked as a `ext` attribute.
Check that it does in fact have the `ext` attribute by making sure it names a `ExtTheorem`
found somewhere in the state's tree, and is not erased.

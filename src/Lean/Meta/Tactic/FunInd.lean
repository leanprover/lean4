This module contains code to derive, from the definition of a recursive function
(or mutually recursive functions) defined by well-founded recursion, a
**functional induction principle** tailored to proofs about that function(s). For
example from:

```
def ackermann : Nat → Nat → Nat
  | 0, m => m + 1
  | n+1, 0 => ackermann n 1
  | n+1, m+1 => ackermann n (ackermann (n + 1) m)
derive_functional_induction ackermann
```
we get
```
ackermann.induct (motive : Nat → Nat → Prop) (case1 : ∀ (m : Nat), motive 0 m)
  (case2 : ∀ (n : Nat), motive n 1 → motive (Nat.succ n) 0)
  (case3 : ∀ (n m : Nat), motive (n + 1) m → motive n (ackermann (n + 1) m) → motive (Nat.succ n) (Nat.succ m))
  (x x : Nat) : motive x x
```

## Specification

The functional induction principle takes the same fixed parameters as the function, and
the motive takes the same non-fixed parameters as the original function.

For each branch of the original function, there is a case in the induction principle.
Here "branch" roughly corresponds to tail-call positions: branches of top-level
`if`-`then`-`else` and of `match` expressions.

For every recursive call in that branch, an induction hypothesis asserting the
motive for the arguments of the recursive call is provided.
If the recursive call is under binders and it, or its proof of termination,
depend on the the bound values, then these become assumptions of the inductive
hypothesis.

Additionally, the local context of the branch (e.g. the condition of an
if-then-else; a let-binding, a have-binding) is provided as assumptions in the
corresponding induction case, if they are likely to be useful (as determined
by `MVarId.cleanup`).

Mutual recursion is supported and results in multiple motives.


## Implementation overview

For a non-mutual, unary function `foo` (or else for the `_unary` function), we

1. expect its definition, possibly after some `whnf`’ing, to be of the form
   ```
   def foo := fun x₁ … xₙ (y : a) => WellFounded.fix (fun y' oldIH => body) y
   ```
   where `xᵢ…` are the fixed parameter prefix and `y` is the varying parameter of
   the function.

2. From this structure we derive the type of the motive, and start assembling the induction
   principle:
   ```
   def foo.induct := fun x₁ … xₙ (motive : (y : a) → Prop) =>
    fix (fun y' newIH => T[body])
   ```

3. The first phase, transformation `T1[body]` (implemented in) `buildInductionBody`,
   mirrors the branching structure of `foo`, i.e. replicates `dite` and some matcher applications,
   while adjusting their motive. It also unfolds calls to `oldIH` and collects induction hypotheses
   in conditions (see below).

   In particular, when translating a `match` it is prepared to recognize the idiom
   as introduced by `mkFix` via `Lean.Meta.MatcherApp.addArg?`, which refines the type of `oldIH`
   throughout the match. The transformation will replace `oldIH` with `newIH` here.
   ```
        T[(match (motive := fun oldIH => …) y with | … => fun oldIH' => body) oldIH]
    ==> (match (motive := fun newIH => …) y with | … => fun newIH' => T[body]) newIH
   ```

   In addition, the information gathered from the match is preserved, so that when performing the
   proof by induction, the user can reliably enter the right case. To achieve this

   * the matcher is replaced by its splitter, which brings extra assumptions into scope when
     patterns are overlapping
   * simple discriminants that are mentioned in the goal (i.e plain parameters) are instantiated
     in the code.
   * for discriminants that are not instantiated that way, equalities connecting the discriminant
     to the instantiation are added (just as if the user wrote `match h : x with …`)

4. When a tail position (no more branching) is found, function `buildInductionCase` assembles the
   type of the case: a fresh `MVar` asserts the current goal, unwanted values from the local context
   are cleared, and the current `body` is searched for recursive calls using `collectIHs`,
   which are then asserted as inductive hyptheses in the `MVar`.

5. The function `collectIHs` walks the term and collects the induction hypotheses for the current case
   (with proofs). When it encounters a saturated application of `oldIH x proof`, it returns
   `newIH x proof : motive x`.

   Since `x` and `proof` can contain further recursive calls, it uses
   `foldCalls` to replace these with calls to `foo`. This assumes that the
   termination proof `proof` works nevertheless.

   Again, `collectIHs` may encounter the `Lean.Meta.Matcherapp.addArg?` idiom, and again it threads `newIH`
   through, replacing the extra argument. The resulting type of this induction hypothesis is now
   itself a `match` statement (cf. `Lean.Meta.MatcherApp.inferMatchType`)

   The termination proof of `foo` may have abstracted over some proofs; these proofs must be transferred, so
   auxillary lemmas are unfolded if needed.

6. The function `foldCalls` replaces calls to `oldIH` with calls to `foo` that
   make sense to the user.

   At the end of this transformation, no mention of `oldIH` must remain.

7. After this construction, the MVars introduced by `buildInductionCase` are turned into parameters.

The resulting term then becomes `foo.induct` at its inferred type.

If `foo` is not unary and/or part of a mutual reduction, then the induction theorem for `foo._unary`
(i.e. the unary non-mutual recursion function produced by the equation compiler)
of the form
```
foo._unary.induct : {motive : (a ⊗' b) ⊕' c → Prop} →
  (case1 : ∀ …, motive (PSum.inl (x,y)) →  …) → … →
  (x : (a ⊗' b) ⊕' c) → motive x
```
will first in `unpackMutualInduction` be turned into a joint induction theorem of the form
```
foo.mutual_induct : {motive1 : a → b → Prop} {motive2 : c → Prop} →
  (case1 : ∀ …, motive1 x y  →  …) → … →
  ((x : a) → (y : b) → motive1 x y) ∧ ((z : c) → motive2 z)
```
where all the `PSum`/`PSigma` encoding has been resolved. This theorem is attached to the
name of the first function in the mutual group, like the `._unary` definition.

Finally, in `deriveUnpackedInduction`, for each of the funtions in the mutual group, a simple
projection yields the final `foo.induct` theorem:
```
foo.induct : {motive1 : a → b → Prop} {motive2 : c → Prop} →
  (case1 : ∀ …, motive1 x y  →  …) → … →
  (x : a) → (y : b) → motive1 x y
```

Like `mkLambdaFVars (usedOnly := true)`, but

 * silently skips expression in `xs` that are not `.isFVar`
 * returns a mask (same size as `xs`) indicating which variables have been abstracted
   (`true` means was abstracted).

The result `r` can be applied with `r.beta (maskArray mask args)`.

We use this when generating the functional induction principle to refine the goal through a `match`,
here `xs` are the discriminans of the `match`.
We do not expect non-trivial discriminants to appear in the goal (and if they do, the user will
get a helpful equality into the context).

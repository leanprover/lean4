Telescopic `generalize` tactic. It can simultaneously generalize many terms.
It uses `kabstract` to occurrences of the terms that need to be generalized.

Remark: we use `TransparencyMode.instances` as the default setting at `generalize`
and `generalizeHyp` to avoid excessive resource usage.

**Motivation:**
The `kabstract e p` operation is widely used, for instance, in the `generalize` tactic.
It operates by taking an expression `e` and a pattern (i.e., an expression containing metavariables)
and employs keyed-matching to identify and abstract instances of `p` within `e`.
For example, if `e` is `a + (2 * (b + c))` and `p` is `2 * ?m`, the resultant expression
would be `a + #0`, where `#0` represents a loose bound variable.

This matching process is not merely syntactic; it also considers reduction. It's impractical
to attempt matching each sub-term with `p`; therefore, only sub-terms sharing the same "root"
symbol are evaluated. For instance, with the pattern `2 * ?m`, only sub-terms with the
root `*` are considered. Matching is executed using the definitionally equality test
(i.e., `isDefEq`).

The `generalize` tactic employs `kabstract` and defaults to standard reducibility.
Hence, the `isDefEq` operations invoked by `kabstract` can become highly resource-intensive
and potentially trigger "max recursion depth reached" errors, as observed in issue #3524.
This issue was isolated by @**Kim Morrison** with the following example:
```
example (a : Nat) : ((2 ^ 7) + a) - 2 ^ 7 = 0 := by
  generalize 0 - 0 = x
```
In this scenario, `kabstract` triggers a "max recursion depth reached" error while
testing whether `((2 ^ 7) + a) - 2 ^ 7` is definitionally equal to `0 - 0`.
Note that the term `((2 ^ 7) + a) - 2 ^ 7` is not ground.
We believe most users find the error message to be uninformative and unexpected.
To fix this issue, we decided to use `TransparencyMode.instances` as the default setting.

Kyle Miller has performed the following analysis on the potential impact of the
changes on Mathlib (2024-03-02).

There seem to be just 130 cases of generalize in Mathlib, and after looking through a
good number of them, they seem to come in just two types:

- Ones where it looks like reducible+instance transparency should work, where in
  particular there is nothing obvious being reduced, and
- Ones that don't make use of the `kabstract` feature at all (it's being used like a
  `have` that introduces an equality for rewriting).

That wasn't a systematic review of generalize though. It's possible changing the
transparency settings would break things, but in my opinion it would be better
if generalize weren't used for unfolding things.

Extension of `generalize` to support generalizing within specified hypotheses.
The `hyps` array contains the list of hypotheses within which to look for occurrences
of the generalizing expressions.

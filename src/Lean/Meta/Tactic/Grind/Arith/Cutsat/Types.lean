/-!
This module implements a model-based decision procedure for linear integer arithmetic,
inspired by Section 4 of "Cutting to the Chase: Solving Linear Integer Arithmetic".
Our implementation includes several enhancements and modifications:
Key Features:
- Extended constraint support (equality and disequality)
- Optimized encoding of `Cooper-Left` rule using "big"-disjunction instead of fresh variables
- Decision variable tracking for case splits (disequalities, `Cooper-Left`, `Cooper-Right`)

Constraint Types:
We handle four categories of linear polynomial constraints (where p is a linear polynomial):
1. Equality:     `p = 0`
2. Divisibility: `d ∣ p`
3. Inequality:   `p ≤ 0`
4. Disequality:  `p ≠ 0`

Implementation Details:
- Polynomials use `Int.Linear.Poly` with sorted linear monomials (leading monomial contains max variable)
- Equalities are eliminated eagerly
- Divisibility constraints are maintained in solved form (one constraint per variable) using `Div-Solve`

Model Construction:
The procedure builds a model incrementally, resolving conflicts through constraint generation.
For example:
Given a partial model `{x := 1}` and constraint `3 ∣ 3*y + x + 1`:
- Cannot extend to `y` because `3 ∣ 3*y + 2` is unsatisfiable
- Generate implied constraint `3 ∣ x + 1`
- Force model update for `x`

Variable Assignment:
When assigning a variable `y`, we consider:
- Best upper and lower bounds (inequalities)
- Divisibility constraint
- Disequality constraints
`Cooper-Left` and `Cooper-Right` rules handle the combination of inequalities and divisibility.
For unsatisfiable disequalities p ≠ 0, we generate case split: `p + 1 ≤ 0 ∨ -p + 1 ≤ 0`

Contradiction Handling:
- Check dependency on decision variables
- If independent, use contradiction to close current grind goal
- Otherwise, trigger backtracking

Optimization:
We employ rational approximation for model construction:
- Continue with rational solutions when integer solutions aren't immediately found
- Helps identify simpler unsatisfiability proofs before full integer model construction

Remark: we will not define a parent structure `Cnstr` with the common
fields until the compiler provides support for avoiding the performance overhead.

/--
The predicate of type `Nat → Prop`, which serves as the conclusion of the
`cooper_left`, `cooper_right`, `cooper_dvd_left`, and `cooper_dvd_right` theorems.

The specific predicate used is determined as follows:
- `cooper_left_split` (if `left` is `true` and `c₃?` is `none`)
- `cooper_right_split` (if `left` is `false` and `c₃?` is `none`)
- `cooper_dvd_left_split` (if `left` is `true` and `c₃?` is `some`)
- `cooper_dvd_right_split` (if `left` is `false` and `c₃?` is `some`)

/--
The `cooper_left`, `cooper_right`, `cooper_dvd_left`, and `cooper_dvd_right` theorems have a resulting type
that is a big-or of the form `OrOver n (cooper_*_split ...)`. The predicate `(cooper_*_split ...)` has type `Nat → Prop`.
The `cutsat` procedure performs case splitting on `(cooper_*_split ... (n-1))` down to `(cooper_*_split ... 1)`.
If it derives `False` from each case, it uses `orOver_resolve` and `orOver_one` to deduce the final case,
which has type `(cooper_*_split ... 0)`.

  Mapping from variables to their "lower" bounds. We say a relational constraint `c` is a lower bound for a variable `x`

  Mapping from variable to occurrences. For example, an entry `x ↦ {y, z}` means that `x` may occur in `dvdCnstrs`, `lowers`, or `uppers` of
  variables `y` and `z`.
  If `x` occurs in `dvdCnstrs[y]`, `lowers[y]`, or `uppers[y]`, then `y` is in `occurs[x]`, but the reverse is not true.

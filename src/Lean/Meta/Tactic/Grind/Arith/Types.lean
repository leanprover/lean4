/--
Auxiliary inductive type for representing contraints and equalities
that should be propagated to core.
Recall that we cannot compute proofs until the short-distance
data-structures have been fully updated when a new edge is inserted.
Thus, we store the information to be propagated into a list.
See field `propagate` in `State`.

The `grind` tactic includes an auxiliary `injection?` tactic that is not intended for direct use by users.
This tactic is automatically applied when introducing non-dependent propositions.
It differs from the user-facing Lean `injection` tactic in the following ways:

- It does not introduce new propositions. Instead, the `grind` tactic preprocessor is responsible for introducing them.
- It assumes that `fvarId` is the latest local declaration in the current goal.
- It does not handle cases where the constructors are different because the simplifier already reduces such equalities to `False`.
- It does not have support for heterogeneous equality. Recall that the simplifier already reduces them to `Eq` if
  the types are definitionally equal.

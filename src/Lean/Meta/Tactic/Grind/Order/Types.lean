/-!
Solver for preorders, partial orders, linear orders, and support for offsets.

/--
A constraint of the form `u ≤ v + k` (`u < v + k` if `strict := true`)
Remark: If the order does not support offsets, then `k` is zero.
`h? := some h` if the Lean expression is not definitionally equal to the constraint,
but provably equal with proof `h`.

  kind   : CnstrKind

  /-- Denotation of this constraint as an expression. -/
  e      : Expr
  /--
  If `h? := some h`, then `h` is proof for that the expression associated with this constraint
  is equal to `e`. Recall that the input constraints are normalized. For example, given `x y : Int`,
  `x ≤ y` is internally represented as `x ≤ y + 0`

/--
Auxiliary inductive type for representing constraints and equalities
that should be propagated to core.
Recall that we cannot compute proofs until the short-distance
data-structures have been fully updated when a new edge is inserted.
Thus, we store the information to be propagated into a list.
See field `propagate` in `State`.

Each type must at least implement the instance `Std.IsPreorder`.

  Expression to be assigned to `goalOld.mvarId` if it is not possible to perform
  non-chronological backtracking.
  `proof` is often a `casesOn` application containing meta-variables.

Given a proof containing meta-variables corresponding to the given subgoals,
create a choice point.
- If there are no choice points, we just close the current goal using `proof`.
- If there is only one subgoal `s`, we close the current goal using `proof`, and
update current goal using `s`.
- If there are more than one `s :: ss`, we create a choice point using the current
goal as the pending goal, and update the current goal with `s`.

Create an auxiliary metavariable with the same type and tag of the metavariable
associated with the current goal.
We use this function to perform `cases` on the current goal without eagerly assignining it.

Use `falseProof` to close the last pending goal in the choice stack,
and reset it.
We use this function when `falseProof` does not have free variables.

Auxliary function for implementing `nextGoal`.
It is similar to `nextGoal`, but uses chronological backtracking.
We use it when we cannot extract a proof of `False` from proof used to close the current goal.
Returns `some gen` if a new goal was found for a choice point with generation `gen`,
and returns `none` otherwise.

Select the next goal to be processed from the `choiceStack`.
This function assumes the current goal has been closed (i.e., `inconsistent` is `true`)
Returns `some gen` if a new goal was found for a choice point with generation `gen`,

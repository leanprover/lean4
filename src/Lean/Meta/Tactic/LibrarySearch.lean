# Library search

This file defines tactics `exact?` and `apply?`,
(formerly known as `library_search`)
and a term elaborator `exact?%`
that tries to find a lemma
solving the current goal
(subgoals are solved using `solveByElim`).

```
example : x < x + 1 := exact?%
example : Nat := by exact?
```

The maximum number of constants an individual task may perform.

initialization performance.

Sequentially invokes a tactic `act` on each value in candidates on the current state.

The tactic `act` should return a list of meta-variables that still need to be resolved.
If this list is empty, then no variables remain to be solved, and `tryOnEach` returns
`none` with the environment set so each goal is resolved.

If the action throws an internal exception with the `abortSpeculationId` id then
further computation is stopped and intermediate results returned. If any other
exception is thrown, then it is silently discarded.

/--
Tries to solve the goal either by:
* calling `tactic true`
* or applying a library lemma then calling `tactic false` on the resulting goals.

Typically here `tactic` is `solveByElim`,
with the `Bool` flag indicating whether it may retry with `exfalso`.

If it successfully closes the goal, returns `none`.
Otherwise, it returns `some a`, where `a : Array (List MVarId × MetavarContext)`,
with an entry for each library lemma which was successfully applied,
containing a list of the subsidiary goals, and the metavariable context after the application.

(Always succeeds, and the metavariable context stored in the monad is reverted,
unless the goal was completely solved.)

(Note that if `solveByElim` solves some but not all subsidiary goals,
this is not currently tracked.)

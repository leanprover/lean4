# "Try this" data types

This defines the data types used in constructing "try this" widgets for suggestion-providing tactics
and inline error-message hints, as well as basic infrastructure for generating info trees and
widget content there from.

Style hooks for `Suggestion`s. See `SuggestionStyle.error`, `.warning`, `.success`, `.value`,
and other definitions here for style presets. This is an arbitrary `Json` object, with the following
interesting fields:
* `title`: the hover text in the suggestion link
* `className`: the CSS classes applied to the link
* `style`: A `Json` object with additional inline CSS styles such as `color` or `textDecoration`.

/-- Holds a `suggestion` for replacement, along with `preInfo` and `postInfo` strings to be printed

  * a status: `.error`, `.warning`, `.success`

  * a variable color: `.value (t : Float)`, which draws from a red-yellow-green gradient, with red

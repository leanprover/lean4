Complete overview over the full Lean LSP API.

The Lean language server requires all files for which it receives requests and notifications
to be opened by a `textDocument/didOpen` notification first, i.e. for the language client
to fully manage the contents of all files.
It will discard notifications and error requests for closed files.
This is in violation with LSP, which leaves the possibility open for language servers to receive
requests for open files, but this violation does not create problems with either VS Code or NeoVim.

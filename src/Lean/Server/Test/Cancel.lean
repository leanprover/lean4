/-!
Helpers for testing cancellation in interactive tests. Put here because of `initialize` restrictions
and to avoid repeated elaboration overhead per test.

namespace Lean.Server.Test.Cancel

initialize onceRef : IO.Ref (Option (Task Unit)) ← IO.mkRef none

/--
On first invocation, sends a diagnostics "blocked", blocks until cancelled, and then eprints
"cancelled!"; further invocations complete when this wait is done but do not wait for their own
cancellation. Thus all document versions should complete strictly after the printing has completed
and we avoid terminating the server too early to see the message.

initialize unblockedCancelTk : IO.CancelToken ← IO.CancelToken.new

/--
Spawns a `logSnapshotTask` that waits for `unblock` to be called, which is expected to happen in a
subsequent document version that does not invalidate this tactic. Complains if cancellation token
was set before unblocking, i.e. if the tactic was invalidated after all.

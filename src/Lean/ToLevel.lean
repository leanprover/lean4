# `ToLevel` class
This module defines `Lean.ToLevel`, which is the `Lean.Level` analogue to `Lean.ToExpr`.

/-- A class to create `Level` expressions that denote particular universe levels in Lean.
`Lean.ToLevel.toLevel.{u}` evaluates to a `Lean.Level` term representing `u` -/

  /-- A `Level` that represents the universe level `u`. -/

  /-- A hack to avoid the "unused universe parameter" error.
    We can remove this field pending issue https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/2116 -/

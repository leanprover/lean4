Determines a prefix to show on a given line when printing diff results.

For `delete`, the prefix is `"-"`, for `insert`, it is `"+"`, and for `skip` it is `" "`.

/--
Finds the least common subsequence of two arrays using a variant of jgit's histogram diff algorithm.

Unlike jgit's implementation, this one does not perform a cutoff on histogram bucket sizes, nor does
it fall back to the Myers diff algorithm. This means that it has quadratic worst-case complexity.
Empirically, however, even quadratic cases of this implementation can handle hundreds of megabytes
in a second or so, and it is intended to be used for short strings like error messages. Be
cautious when applying it to larger workloads.

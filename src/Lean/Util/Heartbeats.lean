# Heartbeats

Functions for interacting with the deterministic timeout heartbeat mechanism.
-/

namespace Lean

/--
Counts the number of heartbeats used during a monadic function.

Remember that user facing heartbeats (e.g. as used in `set_option maxHeartbeats`)
differ from the internally tracked heartbeats by a factor of 1000,
so you need to divide the results here by 1000 before comparing with user facing numbers.

def withHeartbeats [Monad m] [MonadLiftT BaseIO m] (x : m α) : m (α × Nat) := do
  let start ← IO.getNumHeartbeats
  let r ← x
  let finish ← IO.getNumHeartbeats
  return (r, finish - start)

/-- Returns the current `maxHeartbeats`. -/
def getMaxHeartbeats : CoreM Nat := do pure <| (← read).maxHeartbeats

/-- Returns the current `initHeartbeats`. -/
def getInitHeartbeats : CoreM Nat := do pure <| (← read).initHeartbeats

/-- Returns the remaining heartbeats available in this computation. -/
def getRemainingHeartbeats : CoreM Nat := do
  pure <| (← getMaxHeartbeats) - ((← IO.getNumHeartbeats) - (← getInitHeartbeats))

/--
Returns the percentage of the max heartbeats allowed
that have been consumed so far in this computation.
-/
def heartbeatsPercent : CoreM Nat := do
  pure <| ((← IO.getNumHeartbeats) - (← getInitHeartbeats)) * 100 / (← getMaxHeartbeats)

/-- Log a message if it looks like we ran out of time. -/
def reportOutOfHeartbeats (tac : Name) (stx : Syntax) (threshold : Nat := 90) : CoreM Unit := do
  if (← heartbeatsPercent) ≥ threshold then
    logInfoAt stx s!"\
      `{tac}` stopped because it was running out of time.\n\
      You may get better results using `set_option maxHeartbeats 0`."

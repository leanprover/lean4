/--
Tests if any of the binders of `(x₀ : A₀) → (x₁ : A₁) → ⋯ → X` which satisfy `p Aᵢ bi` (with `bi`
the `binderInfo`) are unused in the renainder of the type (i.e. in `(xᵢ₊₁ : Aᵢ₊₁) → ⋯ → X`).

Note that the argument to `p` may have loose bvars. This is a performance optimization.

This function runs `cleanupAnnotations` on each type suffix `(xᵢ₊₁ : Aᵢ₊₁) → ⋯ → X` before
examining it.

We see through `let`s, and do not report if any of them are unused.

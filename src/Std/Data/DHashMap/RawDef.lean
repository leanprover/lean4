Dependent hash maps without a bundled well-formedness invariant, suitable for use in nested
inductive types. The well-formedness invariant is called `Raw.WF`. When in doubt, prefer `DHashMap`
over `DHashMap.Raw`. Lemmas about the operations on `Std.Data.DHashMap.Raw` are available in the
module `Std.Data.DHashMap.RawLemmas`.

The hash table is backed by an `Array`. Users should make sure that the hash map is used linearly to
avoid expensive copies.

This is a simple separate-chaining hash table. The data of the hash map consists of a cached size
and an array of buckets, where each bucket is a linked list of key-value pais. The number of buckets
is always a power of two. The hash map doubles its size upon inserting an element such that the
number of elements is more than 75% of the number of buckets.

The hash map uses `==` (provided by the `BEq` typeclass) to compare keys and `hash` (provided by
the `Hashable` typeclass) to hash them. To ensure that the operations behave as expected, `==`
should be an equivalence relation and `a == b` should imply `hash a = hash b` (see also the
`EquivBEq` and `LawfulHashable` typeclasses). Both of these conditions are automatic if the BEq
instance is lawful, i.e., if `a == b` implies `a = b`.

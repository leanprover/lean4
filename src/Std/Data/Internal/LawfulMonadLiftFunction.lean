# Typeclass for lawfule monad lifting functions

This module provides a typeclass `LawfulMonadLiftFunction f` that asserts that a function `f`
mapping values from one monad to another monad commutes with `pure` and `bind`. This equivalent to
the requirement that the `MonadLift(T)` instance induced by `f` admits a
`LawfulMonadLift(T)` instance.

# Monadic `dropWhile` iterator combinator

This module provides the iterator combinator `IterM.dropWhile` that will drop all values emitted
by a given iterator until a given predicate on these values becomes false the first time. Beginning
with that moment, the combinator will forward all emitted values.

Several variants of this combinator are provided:

* `M` suffix: Instead of a pure function, this variant takes a monadic function. Given a suitable
  `MonadLiftT` instance, it will also allow lifting the iterator to another monad first and then
  applying the mapping function in this monad.
* `WithPostcondition` suffix: This variant takes a monadic function where the return type in the
  monad is a subtype. This variant is in rare cases necessary for the intrinsic verification of an
  iterator, and particularly for specialized termination proofs. If possible, avoid this.

*Note: This is a very general combinator that requires an advanced understanding of monads,
dependent types and termination proofs. The variants `dropWhile` and `dropWhileM` are easier to use
and sufficient for most use cases.*

Given an iterator `it` and a monadic predicate `P`, `it.dropWhileWithPostcondition P` is an iterator
that emits the values emitted by `it` starting from the first value that is rejected by `P`.
The elements before are dropped.

`P` is expected to return `PostconditionT m (ULift Bool)`. The `PostconditionT` transformer allows
the caller to intrinsically prove properties about `P`'s return value in the monad `m`, enabling
termination proofs depending on the specific behavior of `P`.

**Marble diagram (ignoring monadic effects):**

Assuming that the predicate `P` accepts `a` and `b` but rejects `c`:

```text
it                                ---a----b---c--d-e--⊥
it.dropWhileWithPostcondition P   ------------c--d-e--⊥

it                                ---a----⊥
it.dropWhileWithPostcondition P   --------⊥
```

**Termination properties:**

* `Finite` instance: only if `it` is finite
* `Productive` instance: only if `it` is finite

Depending on `P`, it is possible that `it.dropWhileWithPostcondition P` is finite (or productive) although
`it` is not. In this case, the `Finite` (or `Productive`) instance needs to be proved manually.

**Performance:**

This combinator calls `P` on each output of `it` until the predicate evaluates to false. After
that, the combinator incurs an addictional O(1) cost for each value emitted by `it`.

/--
Given an iterator `it` and a monadic predicate `P`, `it.dropWhileM P` is an iterator that
emits the values emitted by `it` starting from the first value that is rejected by `P`.
The elements before are dropped.

If `P` is pure, then the simpler variant `dropWhile` can be used instead.

**Termination properties:**

Depending on `P`, it is possible that `it.dropWhileM P` is finite (or productive) although
`it` is not. In this case, the `Finite` (or `Productive`) instance needs to be proved manually.
Use `dropWhileWithPostcondition` if the termination behavior depends on `P`'s behavior.

This combinator calls `P` on each output of `it` until the predicate evaluates to false. After

Given an iterator `it` and a predicate `P`, `it.dropWhile P` is an iterator that
emits the values emitted by `it` starting from the first value that is rejected by `P`.
The elements before are dropped.

In situations where `P` is monadic, use `dropWhileM` instead.

`it.PlausibleStep step` is the proposition that `step` is a possible next step from the

prove termination (`Finite` or `Productive` instances, for example) of a `dropWhile` iterator.

/--
Given an iterator `it` and a predicate `P`, `it.takeWhile P` is an iterator that outputs
the values emitted by `it` until one of those values is rejected by `P`.
If some emitted value is rejected by `P`, the value is dropped and the iterator terminates.

**Marble diagram:**

Assuming that the predicate `P` accepts `a` and `b` but rejects `c`:

```text
it               ---a----b---c--d-e--⊥
it.takeWhile P   ---a----b---⊥

it               ---a----⊥
it.takeWhile P   ---a----⊥
```

**Termination properties:**

* `Finite` instance: only if `it` is finite
* `Productive` instance: only if `it` is productive

Depending on `P`, it is possible that `it.takeWhile P` is finite (or productive) although `it` is not.
In this case, the `Finite` (or `Productive`) instance needs to be proved manually.

**Performance:**

This combinator calls `P` on each output of `it` until the predicate evaluates to false. Then
it terminates.

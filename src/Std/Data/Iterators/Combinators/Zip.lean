/--
Given two iterators `left` and `right`, `left.zip right` is an iterator that yields pairs of
outputs of `left` and `right`. When one of them terminates,
the `zip` iterator will also terminate.

**Marble diagram:**

```text
left               --a        ---b        --c
right                 --x         --y        --⊥
left.zip right     -----(a, x)------(b, y)-----⊥
```

**Termination properties:**

* `Finite` instance: only if either `left` or `right` is finite and the other is productive
* `Productive` instance: only if `left` and `right` are productive

There are situations where `left.zip right` is finite (or productive) but none of the instances
above applies. For example, if `left` immediately terminates but `right` always skips, then
`left.zip.right` is finite even though no `Finite` (or even `Productive`) instance is available.
Such instances need to be proved manually.

**Performance:**

This combinator incurs an additional O(1) cost with each step taken by `left` or `right`.

Right now, the compiler does not unbox the internal state, leading to worse performance than
theoretically possible.

/--
A wrapper around an iterator that provides partial consumers. See `Iter.allowNontermination`.

structure Iter.Partial {α : Type w} (β : Type w) where
  it : Iter (α := α) β

/--
For an iterator `it`, `it.allowNontermination` provides potentially nonterminating variants of
consumers such as `toList`. They can be used without any proof of termination such as `Finite`
or `Productive`, but as they are implemented with the `partial` declaration modifier, they are
opaque for the kernel and it is impossible to prove anything about them.

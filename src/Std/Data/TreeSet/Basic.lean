# Tree sets

This file develops the type `Std.TreeSet` of tree sets.

Lemmas about the operations on `Std.Data.TreeSet` will be available in the
module `Std.Data.TreeSet.Lemmas`.

See the module `Std.Data.TreeSet.Raw` for a variant of this type which is safe to use in
nested inductive types.

Tree sets.

A tree set stores elements of a certain type in a certain order. It depends on a comparator function
that defines an ordering on the keys and provides efficient order-dependent queries, such as
retrieval of the minimum or maximum.

To ensure that the operations behave as expected, the comparator function `cmp` should satisfy
certain laws that ensure a consistent ordering:

* If `a` is less than (or equal) to `b`, then `b` is greater than (or equal) to `a`
and vice versa (see the `OrientedCmp` typeclass).
* If `a` is less than or equal to `b` and `b` is, in turn, less than or equal to `c`, then `a`
is less than or equal to `c` (see the `TransCmp` typeclass).

Keys for which `cmp a b = Ordering.eq` are considered the same, i.e., there can be only one of them
be contained in a single tree set at the same time.

To avoid expensive copies, users should make sure that the tree set is used linearly.

Internally, the tree sets are represented as size-bounded trees, a type of self-balancing binary
search tree with efficient order statistic lookups.

These tree sets contain a bundled well-formedness invariant, which means that they cannot
be used in nested inductive types. For these use cases, `Std.Data.TreeSet.Raw` and
`Std.Data.TreeSet.Raw.WF` unbundle the invariant from the tree set. When in doubt, prefer
`TreeSet` over `TreeSet.Raw`.

/--
Creates a new empty tree set. It is also possible and recommended to
use the empty collection notations `∅` and `{}` to create an empty tree set. `simp` replaces
`empty` with `∅`.

  emptyCollection := empty

  rfl

/--
Inserts the given element into the set. If the tree set already contains an element that is
equal (with regard to `cmp`) to the given element, then the tree set is returned unchanged.

Note: this non-replacement behavior is true for `TreeSet` and `TreeSet.Raw`.
The `insert` function on `TreeMap`, `DTreeMap`, `TreeMap.Raw` and `DTreeMap.Raw` behaves
differently: it will overwrite an existing mapping.

/--
Checks whether an element is present in a set and inserts the element if it was not found.
If the tree set already contains an element that is equal (with regard to `cmp` to the given
element, then the tree set is returned unchanged.

Equivalent to (but potentially faster than) calling `contains` followed by `insert`.

/--
Returns `true` if `a`, or an element equal to `a` according to the comparator `cmp`, is contained
in the set. There is also a `Prop`-valued version of this: `a ∈ t` is equivalent to
`t.contains a = true`.

Observe that this is different behavior than for lists: for lists, `∈` uses `=` and `contains` uses
`==` for equality checks, while for tree sets, both use the given comparator `cmp`.

/--
Returns a set that contains all mappings of `t₁` and `t₂.

This function ensures that `t₁` is used linearly.
Hence, as long as `t₁` is unshared, the performance characteristics follow the following imperative
description: Iterate over all mappings in `t₂`, inserting them into `t₁`.

Hence, the runtime of this method scales logarithmically in the size of `t₁` and linearly in the
size of `t₂` as long as `t₁` is unshared.

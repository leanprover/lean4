# Asynchronous Programming Primitives

This module provides a layered approach to asynchronous programming, combining monadic types,
type classes, and concrete task types that work together in a cohesive system.

- **Monadic Types**: These types provide a good way to to chain and manipulate context. These
  can contain a `Task`, enabling manipulation of both asynchronous and synchronous code.
- **Concrete Task Types**: Concrete units of work that can be executed within these contexts.

## Monadic Types

These types provide a good way to to chain and manipulate context. These can contain a `Task`,
enabling manipulation of both asynchronous and synchronous code.

- `BaseAsync`: A monadic type for infallible asynchronous computations
- `EAsync`: A monadic type for asynchronous computations that may fail with an error of type
  `ε`
- `Async`: A monadic type for IO-based asynchronous computations that may fail with `IO.Error`
  (alias for `EAsync IO.Error`)

## Concurrent Units of Work

These are the concrete computational units that exist within the monadic contexts. These types
should not be created directly.

- `Task`: A computation that will resolve to a value of type `α`,
- `ETask`: A task that may fail with an error of type `ε`.
- `AsyncTask`: A task that may fail with an `IO.Error` (alias for `ETask IO.Error`).

## Relation

These types are related by two functions in the type classes `MonadAsync` and `MonadAwait`: `async`
and `await`. The `async` function extracts a concrete asynchronous task from a computation within the
monadic context. In effect, it runs the computation in the background and returns a task handle that
can be awaited later. On the other hand, the `await` function takes a task and re-inserts it into the
monadic context, allowing its result to be composed using monadic bind and also pausing to wait for that result.
This relationship between `async` and `await` enables precise control over when a computation begins
and when its result is used. You can spawn multiple asynchronous tasks using `async`, perform other
operations in the meantime, and later rejoin the computation flow by awaiting their results.

These functions should not be used directly. Instead, prefer higher-level combinators such as
`race`, `raceAll`, `concurrently`, `background` and `concurrentlyAll`. The best way to think about
how to write your async code, it to avoid using the concurrent units of work, and only use it when integrating
with non async code that uses them.

All other results are lost, and the tasks are not cancelled, so they'll continue their executing
until the end.

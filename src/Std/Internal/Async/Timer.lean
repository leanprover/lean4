/--
`Sleep` can be used to sleep for some duration once.
The underlying timer has millisecond resolution.
-/
structure Sleep where
  private ofNative ::
    native : Internal.UV.Timer

namespace Sleep

/--
Set up a `Sleep` that waits for `duration` milliseconds.
This function only initializes but does not yet start the timer.

If:
- `s` is not yet running start it and return an `Async` computation that will complete once the previously
   configured `duration` has elapsed.
- `s` is already or not anymore running return the same `Async` computation as the first call to `wait`.

def wait (s : Sleep) : Async Unit :=
  Async.ofPurePromise s.native.next

/--
If:
- `s` is still running the timer restarts counting from now and completes after `duration`
  milliseconds.
- `s` is not yet or not anymore running this is a no-op.

  s.native.reset

/--
If:
- `s` is still running this stops `s` without completing any remaining `Async` computations that were created
  through `wait`. Note that if another `Async` computation is binding on any of these it will hang
  forever without further intervention.
- `s` is not yet or not anymore running this is a no-op.

/--
Create a `Selector` that resolves once `s` has finished. Note that calling this function starts `s`
if it hasn't already started.

Return an `Async` computation that completes after `duration`.

`Interval` can be used to repeatedly wait for some duration like a clock.
The underlying timer has millisecond resolution.

structure Interval where

Setup up an `Interval` that waits for `duration` milliseconds.
This function only initializes but does not yet start the timer.

If:
- `i` is not yet running start it and return an `Async` computation that completes right away as the 0th
  multiple of `duration` has elapsed.
- `i` is already running and:
  - the tick from the last call of `i` has not yet finished return the same `Async` computation as the last
    call
  - the tick from the last call of `i` has finished return a new `Async` computation that waits for the
    closest next tick from the time of calling this function.
- `i` is not running anymore this is a no-op.

/--
If:
- `Interval.tick` was called on `i` before the timer restarts counting from now and the next tick
   happens in `duration`.
- `i` is not yet or not anymore running this is a no-op.

  i.native.reset

/--
If:
- `i` is still running this stops `i` without completing any remaining `Async` computations that were created
  through `tick`. Note that if another `Async` computation is binding on any of these it will hang
  forever without further intervention.

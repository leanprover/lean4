`Timer`s are used to generate `IO.Promise`s that resolve after some time.

A `Timer` can be in one of 3 states:
- Right after construction it's initial.
- While it is ticking it's running.
- If it has stopped for some reason it's finished.

This together with whether it was set up as `repeating` with `Timer.new` determines the behavior
of all functions on `Timer`s.

def Timer : Type := TimerImpl.type

instance : Nonempty Timer := TimerImpl.property

namespace Timer

/--
This creates a `Timer` in the initial state and doesn't run it yet.
- If `repeating` is `false` this constructs a timer that resolves once after `timeout`
  milliseconds, counting from when it's run.
- If `repeating` is `true` this constructs a timer that resolves after multiples of `timeout`
  milliseconds, counting from when it's run. Note that this includes the 0th multiple right after
  starting the timer. Furthermore a repeating timer will only be freed after `Timer.stop` is called.

opaque mk (timeout : UInt64) (repeating : Bool) : IO Timer

/--
This function has different behavior depending on the state and configuration of the `Timer`:
- if `repeating` is `false` and:
  - it is initial, run it and return a new `IO.Promise` that is set to resolve once `timeout`
    milliseconds have elapsed. After this `IO.Promise` is resolved the `Timer` is finished.
  - it is running or finished, return the same `IO.Promise` that the first call to `next` returned.
- if `repeating` is `true` and:
  - it is initial, run it and return a new `IO.Promise` that resolves right away
    (as it is the 0th multiple of `timeout`).
  - it is running, check whether the last returned `IO.Promise` is already resolved:
     - If it is, return a new `IO.Promise` that resolves upon finishing the next cycle
     - If it is not, return the last `IO.Promise`
     This ensures that the returned `IO.Promise` resolves at the next repetition of the timer.
  - if it is finished, return the last `IO.Promise` created by `next`. Notably this could be one
    that never resolves if the timer was stopped before fulfilling the last one.

@[extern "lean_uv_timer_next"]
opaque next (timer : @& Timer) : IO (IO.Promise Unit)

/--
This function has different behavior depending on the state and configuration of the `Timer`:
- If it is initial or finished this is a no-op.
- If it is running and `repeating` is `false` this will delay the resolution of the timer until
  `timeout` milliseconds after the call of this function.
- Delay the resolution of the next tick of the timer until `timeout` milliseconds after the
  call of this function, then continue normal ticking behavior from there.

@[extern "lean_uv_timer_reset"]
opaque reset (timer : @& Timer) : IO Unit

/--
This function has different behavior depending on the state of the `Timer`:
- If it is initial or finished this is a no-op.
- If it is running the execution of the timer is stopped and it is put into the finished state.
  Note that if the last `IO.Promise` generated by `next` is unresolved and being waited
  on this creates a memory leak and the waiting task is not going to be awoken anymore.

The `Std.Sync.Broadcast` module implements a broadcasting primitive for sending values
to multiple consumers. It maintains a queue of values and supports both synchronous
and asynchronous waiting.

This module is heavily inspired by `Std.Sync.Channel` as well as
[tokio’s broadcast implementation](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/blob/master/tokio/src/sync/broadcast.rs).

synchronous mode use `Broadcast.sync`.

Subscribers only receive messages sent after they have subscribed (unless otherwise specified).

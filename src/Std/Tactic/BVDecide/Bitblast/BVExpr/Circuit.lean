This directory contains the implementation and verification of the bitblaster for `BitVec` problems
with boolean substructure. For any primitive operation defined in `Basic` there does exist one
file in `Impl`, containing the bitblaster and one file in `Lemmas`, demonstrating that the circuit
produced by the bitblaster is correct.

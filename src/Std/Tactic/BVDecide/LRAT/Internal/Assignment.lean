The `Assignment` inductive datatype is used in the `assignments` field of default formulas (defined in
Formula.Implementation.lean) to store and quickly access information about whether unit literals are
contained in (or entailed by) a formula.

The elements of `Assignment` can be viewed as a lattice where `both` is top, satisfying both `hasPosAssignment`
and `hasNegAssignment`, `pos` satisfies only the former, `neg` satisfies only the latter, and `unassigned` is
bottom, satisfying neither. If one wanted to modify the default formula structure to use a BitArray rather than
an `Assignment Array` for the `assignments` field, a reasonable 2-bit representation of the `Assignment` type
would be:
- both: 11
- pos: 10
- neg: 01
- unassigned: 00

Then `hasPosAssignment` could simply query the first bit and `hasNegAssignment` could simply query the second bit.

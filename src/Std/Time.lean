# Time

The Lean API for date, time, and duration functionalities.

# Overview

This module of the standard library defines various concepts related to time, such as dates, times,
time zones and durations. These types are designed to be strongly-typed and to avoid problems with
conversion. It offers both unbounded and bounded variants to suit different use cases, like
adding days to a date or representing ordinal values.

# Date and Time Components

Date and time components are classified into different types based how you SHOULD use them. These
components are categorized as:

## Offset

Offsets represent unbounded shifts in specific date or time units. They are typically used in operations
like `date.addDays` where a `Day.Offset` is the parameter. Some offsets, such as `Month.Offset`, do not
correspond directly to a specific duration in seconds, as their value depends on the context (if
the year is leap or the size of the month). Offsets with a clear correspondent to seconds can be
converted because they use an internal type called `UnitVal`.

- Types with a correspondence to seconds:
  - `Day.Offset`
  - `Hour.Offset`
  - `Week.Offset`
  - `Millisecond.Offset`
  - `Nanosecond.Offset`
  - `Second.Offset`

- Types without a correspondence to seconds:
  - `Month.Offset`
  - `Year.Offset`

## Ordinal

Ordinal types represent specific bounded values in reference to another unit, e.g., `Day.Ordinal`
represents a day in a month, ranging from 1 to 31. Some ordinal types like `Hour.Ordinal` and `Second.Ordinal`,
allow for values beyond the normal range (e.g, 60 seconds) to accommodate special cases with leap seconds
like `23:59:60` that is valid in ISO 8601.

- Ordinal types:
  - `Day.Ordinal`: Ranges from 1 to 31.
  - `Day.Ordinal.OfYear`: Ranges from 1 to (365 or 366).
  - `Month.Ordinal`: Ranges from 1 to 12.
  - `WeekOfYear.Ordinal`: Ranges from 1 to 53.
  - `Hour.Ordinal`: Ranges from 0 to 23.
  - `Millisecond.Ordinal`: Ranges from 0 to 999.
  - `Minute.Ordinal`: Ranges from 0 to 59.
  - `Nanosecond.Ordinal`: Ranges from 0 to 999,999,999.
  - `Second.Ordinal`: Ranges from 0 to 60.
  - `Weekday`: That is a inductive type with all the seven days.

## Span

Span types are used as subcomponents of other types. They represent a range of values in the limits
of the parent type, e.g, `Nanosecond.Span` ranges from -999,999,999 to 999,999,999, as 1,000,000,000
nanoseconds corresponds to one second.

- Span types:
  - `Nanosecond.Span`: Ranges from -999,999,999 to 999,999,999.

# Date and Time Types

Dates and times are made up of different parts. An `Ordinal` is an absolute value, like a specific day in a month,
while an `Offset` is a shift forward or backward in time, used in arithmetic operations to add or subtract days, months or years.
Dates use components like `Year.Ordinal`, `Month.Ordinal`, and `Day.Ordinal` to ensure they represent
valid points in time.

Some types, like `Duration`, include a `Span` to represent ranges over other types, such as `Second.Offset`.
This type can have a fractional nanosecond part that can be negative or positive that is represented as a `Nanosecond.Span`.

## Date
These types provide precision down to the day level, useful for representing and manipulating dates.

- **`PlainDate`:** Represents a calendar date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Time
These types offer precision down to the nanosecond level, useful for representing and manipulating time of day.

- **`PlainTime`**: Represents a time of day in the format `HH:mm:ss,sssssssss`.

## Date and time
Combines date and time into a single representation, useful for precise timestamps and scheduling.

- **`PlainDateTime`**: Represents both date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss,sssssssss`.
- **`Timestamp`**: Represents a specific point in time with nanosecond precision. Its zero value corresponds
to the UNIX epoch. This type should be used when sending or receiving timestamps between systems.

## Zoned date and times.
Combines date, time and time zones.

- **`DateTime`**: Represents both date and time but with a time zone in the type constructor.
- **`ZonedDateTime`**: Is a way to represent date and time that includes `ZoneRules`, which consider
Daylight Saving Time (DST). This means it can handle local time changes throughout the year better
than a regular `DateTime`. If you want to use a specific time zone without worrying about DST, you can
use the `ofTimestampWithZone` function, which gives you a `ZonedDateTime` based only on that time zone,
without considering the zone rules, otherwise you can use `ofTimestamp` or `ofTimestampWithIdentifier`.

## Duration
Represents spans of time and the difference between two points in time.

- **`Duration`**: Represents the time span or difference between two `Timestamp`s values with nanosecond precision.

# Formats

Format strings are used to convert between `String` representations and date/time types, like `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.sssZ`.
The table below shows the available format specifiers. Some specifiers can be repeated to control truncation or offsets.
When a character is repeated `n` times, it usually truncates the value to `n` characters.

The supported formats include:
- `G`: Represents the era, such as AD (Anno Domini) or BC (Before Christ).
  - `G`, `GG`, `GGG` (short): Displays the era in a short format (e.g., "AD").

- **`time("HH:mm:ss.sssssssss")`**: Represents a time in the format `HH:mm:ss.sssssssss`, including optional support for nanoseconds.
- **`datetime("uuuu-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.sssssssss")`**: Represents a datetime value in the `uuuu-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.sssssssss` format, with optional nanoseconds.
- **`offset("+HH:mm")`**: Represents a timezone offset in the format `+HH:mm`, where `+` or `-` indicates the direction from UTC.
- **`timezone("NAME/ID ZZZ")`**: Specifies a timezone using a region-based name or ID, along with its associated offset.

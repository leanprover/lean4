# Lean compiler
#
# A simple wrapper around a C++ compiler. Defaults to the compiler Lean was built with,
# which can be overridden with the environment variable `LEAN_CXX`. All parameters are passed
# as-is to the wrapped compiler. Note that we use a C++ compiler purely for linking against
# the C++ standard library Lean depends on, all input files are treated as C code.
#
# Interesting options:
# * `-U LEAN_MULTI_THREAD` can be used to optimize programs not making use of multi-threading

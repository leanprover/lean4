/-! ## Detection Functions -/

/--
Attempt to detect an Elan installation by checking the `ELAN` and `ELAN_HOME`
environment variables. If `ELAN` is set but empty, Elan is considered disabled.
-/
def findElanInstall? : BaseIO (Option ElanInstall) := do
  if let some home ← IO.getEnv "ELAN_HOME" then
    let elan := (← IO.getEnv "ELAN").getD "elan"
    if elan.trim.isEmpty then
      return none
    else
      return some {elan, home}
  return none

/--
Attempt to find the sysroot of the given `lean` command (if it exists)
by calling `lean --print-prefix` and returning the path it prints.
Defaults to trying the `lean` in `PATH`.
-/
def findLeanSysroot? (lean := "lean") : BaseIO (Option FilePath) := do
  let act : IO _ := do
    let out ← IO.Process.output {
      cmd := lean,
      args := #["--print-prefix"]
    }
    if out.exitCode == 0 then
      pure <| some <| FilePath.mk <| out.stdout.trim
    else
      pure <| none
  act.catchExceptions fun _ => pure none

/--
Construct the `LeanInstall` object for the given Lean sysroot.

Does the following:
1. Find `lean`'s githash.
2. Finds the  `ar` and `cc` to use with Lean.
3. Computes the sub-paths of the Lean install.

For (1), If `lake` is not-collocated with `lean`, invoke `lean --githash`;
otherwise, use Lake's `Lean.githash`. If the invocation fails, `githash` is
set to the empty string.

For (2), if `LEAN_AR` or `LEAN_CC` are defined, it uses those paths.
Otherwise, if Lean is packaged with an `llvm-ar` and/or `clang`, use them.
If not, use the `ar` and/or `cc` from the `AR` / `CC` environment variables
or the system's `PATH`. This last step is needed because internal builds of
Lean do not bundle these tools (unlike user-facing releases).

We also track whether `LEAN_CC` was set to determine whether it should
be set in the future for `lake env`. This is because if `LEAN_CC` was not set,
it needs to remain not set for `leanc` to work.
Even setting it to the bundled compiler will break `leanc` -- see
[leanprover/lean4#1281](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/1281).

For (3), it assumes that the Lean installation is organized the normal way.
That is, with its binaries located in `<lean-sysroot>/bin`, its
Lean libraries in `<lean-sysroot>/lib/lean`, and its system libraries in
`<lean-sysroot>/lib`.

Attempt to detect the installation of the given `lean` command
by calling `findLeanSysroot?`. See `LeanInstall.get` for how it assumes the
Lean install is organized.

  OptionT.run do LeanInstall.get (← findLeanSysroot? lean)

/--
Check if the running Lake's executable is co-located with Lean, and, if so,
try to return their joint home by assuming they are both located at `<home>/bin`.
-/
def findLakeLeanJointHome? : BaseIO (Option FilePath) := do
  if let .ok appPath ← IO.appPath.toBaseIO then

Get the root of Lake's installation by assuming the executable
is located at `<lake-home>/.lake/build/bin/lake`.
-/
def lakeBuildHome? (lake : FilePath) : Option FilePath := do

/--
Heuristically validate that `getLakeBuildHome?` is a proper Lake installation
by check for `Lake.olean` in the installation's `lib` directory.
-/
def getLakeInstall? (lake : FilePath) : BaseIO (Option LakeInstall) := do
  let some home := lakeBuildHome? lake | return none
  let lake : LakeInstall := {home, lake}
  if (← lake.libDir / "Lake.olean" |>.pathExists) then
    return lake
  return none

/--
Attempt to detect Lean's installation by using the `LEAN` and `LEAN_SYSROOT`
environment variables.

If `LEAN_SYSROOT` is set, use it. Otherwise, check `LEAN` for the `lean`
executable. If `LEAN` is set but empty, Lean will be considered disabled.
Otherwise, Lean's location will be determined by trying `findLeanSysroot?`
using value of `LEAN` or, if unset, the `lean` in `PATH`.

See `LeanInstall.get` for how it assumes the Lean install is organized.
-/
def findLeanInstall? : BaseIO (Option LeanInstall) := do
  if let some sysroot ← IO.getEnv "LEAN_SYSROOT" then
    return some <| ← LeanInstall.get sysroot
  let lean ← do
    if let some lean ← IO.getEnv "LEAN" then
      if lean.trim.isEmpty then
        return none
      else
        pure lean
    else
      pure "lean"
  if let some sysroot ← findLeanSysroot? lean then
    return some <| ← LeanInstall.get sysroot
  return none

/--
Attempt to detect Lake's installation by first checking the `lakeBuildHome?`
of the running executable, then trying the `LAKE_HOME` environment variable.

It assumes that the Lake installation is organized the same way it is built.
That is, with its binary located at `<lake-home>/.lake/build/bin/lake` and its
static library and `.olean` files in `<lake-home>/.lake/build/lib`, and
its source files located directly in `<lake-home>`.
-/
def findLakeInstall? : BaseIO (Option LakeInstall) := do
  if let Except.ok lake ← IO.appPath.toBaseIO then
    if let some lake ← getLakeInstall? lake then
      return lake
  if let some home ← IO.getEnv "LAKE_HOME" then
    return some {home}
  return none

/--
Attempt to automatically detect an Elan, Lake, and Lean installation.

First, it calls `findElanInstall?` to detect a Elan installation.
Then it attempts to detect if Lake and Lean are part of a single installation
where the `lake` executable is co-located with the `lean` executable (i.e., they
are in the same directory). If Lean and Lake are not co-located, Lake will
attempt  to find the their installations separately by calling
`findLeanInstall?` and `findLakeInstall?`. Setting `LAKE_OVERRIDE_LEAN` to true
will force Lake to use `findLeanInstall?` even if co-located.

When co-located, Lake will assume that Lean and Lake's binaries are located in
`<sysroot>/bin`, their Lean libraries  in `<sysroot>/lib/lean`, Lean's source files
in `<sysroot>/src/lean`, and Lake's source files in `<sysroot>/src/lean/lake`,
following the pattern of a regular Lean toolchain.

The pipeline phase a certain `Pass` is supposed to happen in.

/--
A single compiler `Pass`, consisting of the actual pass function operating
on the `Decl`s as well as meta information.
-/
structure Pass where
  /--
  Which occurence of the pass in the pipeline this is.
  Some passes, like simp, can occur multiple times in the pipeline.
  For most passes this value does not matter.

  /--
  Which phase this `Pass` is supposed to run in
  -/

  /--
  The name of the `Pass`
  -/

  /--
  The actual pass function, operating on the `Decl`s.

/--
Can be used to install, remove, replace etc. passes by tagging a declaration
of type `PassInstaller` with the `cpass` attribute.
-/
structure PassInstaller where
  /--
  When the installer is run this function will receive a list of all
  current `Pass`es and return a new one, this can modify the list (and
  the `Pass`es contained within) in any way it wants.

The `PassManager` used to store all `Pass`es that will be run within

# Building a stage mostly affects files in that stage's build directory.
# However, the bench suite runs inside the source directory for developer UX
# reasons, so some stage-specific bench suite files are generated in the source
# directory (namely the env_*.sh files).
#
# To avoid messing up the rest of the bench suite, we restore those files to
# STAGE_THIS's versions immediately after we configure STAGE_NEXT. Yes, this is
# a big hack, but it allows running the build benchmark as part of the bench
# suite instead of completely separately.
#
# Configuring STAGE_NEXT also builds all stages up to and including STAGE_THIS.

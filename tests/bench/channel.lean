https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/tree/bd87a61ce3858ca772c42525d5f0c9aa12cc80ac/crossbeam-channel/benchmarks.

We conduct for:
- capacity 0 channels
- capacity 1 channels
- capacity `N` channels
- unbounded channels

the following tests:
- `seq`: A single thread sends `N` messages. Then it receives `N` messages.
- `spsc`: One thread sends `N` messages. Another thread receives `N` messages.
- `mpsc`: `T` threads send `N / T` messages each. One thread receives `N` messages.
- `mpmc`: `T` threads send `N / T` messages each. `T` other threads receive `N / T` messages each.

Note that we will stick exclusively to the sync interface for this as there is no benefit to be
reaped from async in this benchmark so we might as well just block.

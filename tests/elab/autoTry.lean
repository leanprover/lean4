Tests for the `autoTry.*` post-elab hook options:
  - `autoTry.onEmptyProof` -- run `try?` on *empty* tactic-sequence containers; rendered
    as an *append* (a strict subset of `autoTry.onUnsolvedGoal`).
  - `autoTry.onUnsolvedGoal` -- run `try?` on each tactic-sequence container whose body
    left exactly one unsolved goal; rendered as an *append* to the sequence.
  - `autoTry.onSorry` -- run `try?` on `sorry` tactics; rendered as a *replacement* of
    the `sorry`.

Tests use opaque propositions `P`, `Q`, and a user-registered `@[try_suggestion]` that
returns one deterministic suggestion per goal type. `debug.tactic.try.onlyUserSuggestions`
disables the expensive built-in branches of `try?` (`simp` / `grind` / `exact?` / …) so
the test output stays small and stable.

unsolved, the suggestion runs `try?` against the focused goal *as the wrapper sees
it after its body ran* -- including any hypotheses the body introduced.

The tests below introduce a hypothesis `h : P`; the suggester prefers `exact h` when
`h` is in scope, so the visible suggestion text changes from `exact Pintro` to
`exact h` when the hypothesis is correctly threaded through. -/

/-! ## Suggester context matches the elaboration scope at log time

The hook recovers the suggester's elaboration context for unsolved-goal triggers from
the `MessageData.withContext` (env, mctx, lctx, opts) and `MessageData.withNamingContext`
(currNamespace, openDecls) wrappers that the standard log machinery attaches to every
logged message. Those values come from the active `Core.Context` at log time, so every
scope shift in effect when `Term.reportUnsolvedGoals` fired -- command-level
`open … in <cmd>`, term-level `open … in <term>`, the macro-expanded inner command of
`set_option … in`, plain `withTheReader Core.Context` overrides in custom elaborators
-- is captured automatically with no InfoTree round-trip.

The suggester below builds the witness as an `Expr` and delaborates it with
`PrettyPrinter.delab`, so the rendered identifier goes through the real
openDecls-aware delaborator -- the same path `exact?` uses to format its hits. -/

For an empty `tacticSeq1Indented` the body has no `getPos?`/`getTailPos?`, so
`findTacticSeqBody` falls back to `range.stop` -- the stop position of the underlying
`Tactic.unsolvedGoals` message. That's "just past the opener" (`by`, `·`, `=>`)
*only because* `Term.reportUnsolvedGoals` happens to log the error at the surrounding
`byTactic` / `cdot` / `case` syntax, whose total width equals the opener's width when
the body is empty. The tests below pin those positions so any future change that widens
the producer's `ref` (e.g. logging at an enclosing term ref) shows up as a test
failure rather than as a silent off-by-many-characters insertion. -/

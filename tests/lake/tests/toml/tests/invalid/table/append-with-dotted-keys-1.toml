# First a.b.c defines a table: a.b.c = {z=9}
#
# Then we define a.b.c.t = "str" to add a str to the above table, making it:
#
#   a.b.c = {z=9, t="..."}
#
# While this makes sense, logically, it was decided this is not valid TOML as
# it's too confusing/convoluted.
# 
# See: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/846
#      https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/pull/859

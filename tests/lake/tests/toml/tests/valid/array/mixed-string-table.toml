# Start with a table as the first element. This tests a case that some libraries
# might have where they will check if the first entry is a table/map/hash/assoc
# array and then encode it as a table array. This was a reasonable thing to do
# before TOML 1.0 since arrays could only contain one type, but now it's no
# longer.

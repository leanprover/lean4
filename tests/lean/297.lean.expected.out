297.lean:1:10-1:11: error(lean.synthInstanceFailed): failed to synthesize instance of type class
  OfNat (Sort ?u) 0
numerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `0` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is
  Sort ?u
due to the absence of the instance above

Hint: Type class instance resolution failures can be inspected with the `set_option trace.Meta.synthInstance true` command.

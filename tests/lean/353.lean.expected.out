353.lean:13:26-13:50: error: typeclass instance problem is stuck
  Arr.{?u, ?u + 1} (@?m a₁ a₂) (Sort ?u)

Note: Lean will not try to resolve this typeclass instance problem because the first type argument to Arr.{u1,
  u2} contains metavariables. This argument is an input, and so it must be fully determined before Lean will try to resolve the typeclass.

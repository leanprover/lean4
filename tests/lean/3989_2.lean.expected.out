3989_2.lean:6:0: error: expected else-alternative for `match_expr`, i.e., `| _ => ...`
3989_2.lean:1:22-1:32: error: Function expected at
  MetaM
but this term has type
  ?m

Note: Expected a function because this term is being applied to the argument
  Expr

Hint: The identifier `MetaM` is unknown, and Lean's `autoImplicit` option causes an unknown identifier to be treated as an implicitly bound variable with an unknown type. However, the unknown type cannot be a function, and a function is what Lean expects here. This is often the result of a typo or a missing `import` or `open` statement.

bigUnivOffsets.lean:1:12-1:21: error: Universe level offset `100000000` exceeds maximum offset `32`

Note: This code is probably misusing universe levels, since they are usually small natural numbers. If you are confident this is not the case, you can increase the limit using `set_option maxUniverseOffset <limit>`

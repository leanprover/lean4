Claude prompt:
You are a Lean 4 proof assistant. Your task is to suggest tactics to replace the `sorry` placeholder in the proof below.

File context (preceding the current declaration):
```lean
/-
Test that the claude tactic works with template variable extraction,
including tactic steps before the claude call.
-/
import Lean -- remove after update-stage0

-- Use mock to avoid actually calling Claude
set_option tactic.claude.mock "{\"tactics\": [\"omega\"]}"

-- Enable prompt tracing to verify template variables
set_option trace.claude.prompt true

-- A helper definition to test file context capture
def helper : Nat := 42

-- Test that claude tactic includes prior tactic steps in the declaration
```

Declaration with proof so far (replace the sorry):
```lean
theorem myTheorem (n m : Nat) : n + m = m + n := by
  have h : n = n := rfl
  sorry
```

Current goal at sorry:
```lean
n m : Nat
h : n = n
⊢ n + m = m + n
```

Provide your response as ONLY the raw JSON, with no explanation, no markdown code fences, no backticks:
{"tactics": ["tactic1", "tactic2", "tactic3"]}

Requirements:
- Suggest 1-5 tactics to replace the sorry, ordered by likelihood of success
- Each tactic must be valid Lean 4 syntax
- Tactics should be concrete and actionable
- Prefer simpler tactics when applicable
- You may include newlines in a tactic string for multi-step sequences (e.g., "intro x\napply foo")
Try this:
  [apply] omega

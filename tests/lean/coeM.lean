Making sure the monad lift coercion elaborator does not have side effects.

It used to be responsible for hinting that the LHSs of equalities were defeq, like in the following example.
It was checking that `Eq (some true)` and `Eq _` were defeq monads. The defeq check caused `_` to be solved as `some true`.

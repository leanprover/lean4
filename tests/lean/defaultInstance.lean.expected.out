defaultInstance.lean:22:35-22:38: error: typeclass instance problem is stuck
  Foo Bool (?m x)

Note: Lean will not try to resolve this typeclass instance problem because the second type argument to Foo contains metavariables. This argument is an input, and so it must be fully determined before Lean will try to resolve the typeclass.

/-! # `dsimp` uses theorems whose proofs are unapplied constants

This test ensures that `dsimp` can take advantage of `@[simp]` theorems whose proofs are unapplied
constants which are marked as `rfl` theorems.

## Context

To determine if a `@[simp]` theorem is a `rfl` theorem (and therefore usable by `dsimp`), we check
if its proof is one of the following:

1. directly a `rfl` proof, e.g. `Eq.rfl`
2. a `symm` proof of `rfl` proofs
3. an application of a constant which is considered a `rfl` theorem

This means that a theorem `foo` whose proofs is of the form `foo_internal_with_arg 0` where
`foo_internal_with_arg` is a `rfl` theorem. The first section
demonstrates that behavior as a control case.

We also want to consider a theorem a `rfl` theorem if its proof is simply:

4. a constant which is a `rfl` theorem

and is not necessarily applied to any arguments.

This behavior is ensured by the test case in the second section.

See issue #2685.

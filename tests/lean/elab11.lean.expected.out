Additional information:
elab11.lean:6:7: context: switched to basic overload resolution where arguments are elaborated without any information about the expected type because expected type was not available
sorry : ?M_1

elab11.lean:16:8: error: none of the overloads are applicable
error for bla.f
invalid overload, expression

Additional information:
elab11.lean:16:8: context: switched to basic overload resolution where arguments are elaborated without any information about the expected type, because failed to elaborate all candidates using the expected type
  string
this can happen because, for example, coercions were not considered in the process
none of the overloads are applicable

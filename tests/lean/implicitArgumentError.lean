In the past, when an implicit argument couldn't be synthesized, the name of the argument got lost during elaboration.
Now it is saved and added to the error message.

In this example, that is 'n'.

def foo {n : Nat} := 2*n

The argument `n` is not determined by the other arguments or the expected type in
  @foo ?_

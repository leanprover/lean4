inductive1.lean:4:15-4:18: error: Invalid resulting type: Expected a sort or an indexed family of sorts

Hint: Examples of valid sorts include `Type _`, `Sort _`, and `Prop`
inductive1.lean:12:0-12:19: error: Invalid mutually inductive types: The resulting type of this declaration
  Type
differs from a preceding one
  Prop

Note: All inductive types declared in the same `mutual` block must belong to the same type universe
inductive1.lean:22:0-22:37: error: Invalid mutually inductive types: The resulting type of this declaration
  Type v
differs from a preceding one
  Type u

Note: All inductive types declared in the same `mutual` block must belong to the same type universe
inductive1.lean:31:0-31:41: error: Invalid mutually inductive types: Parameter `x` has type
  Bool
but is expected to have type
  Nat
inductive1.lean:40:0-40:30: error: Invalid mutually inductive types: `T2` has 1 parameter(s), but the preceding type `T1` has 2

Note: All inductive types declared in the same `mutual` block must have the same parameters
inductive1.lean:49:0-49:40: error: Invalid mutually inductive types: Binder annotations for parameter `x` must match
inductive1.lean:59:0-59:45: error: Universe parameter mismatch in mutually inductive types: `T2` has universe parameters
  `w2`, `v`, `u`
but the preceding declaration `T1` has
  `w1`, `v`, `u`

Note: All inductive declarations in the same `mutual` block must have the same universe level parameters
inductive1.lean:69:2-69:5: error: `Boo.T1.bla` has already been declared
inductive1.lean:73:10-73:12: error: `Boo.T1` has already been declared
inductive1.lean:80:0-80:27: error: Invalid modifier: Inductive declarations cannot be marked as `partial`
inductive1.lean:81:0-81:33: error: Invalid modifier: Inductive declarations cannot be marked as `noncomputable`
inductive1.lean:82:2-82:8: error: Cannot add attribute `[inline]`: Declaration `T1'` is not a definition
inductive1.lean:85:0-85:17: error: Constructor cannot be marked `private` because it is already in a `private` inductive datatype

Hint: Remove `private` modifier from constructor

inductive1.lean:93:7-93:26: error: Invalid mutually inductive types: `T2` is unsafe, but `T1` is safe

Note: Safe and unsafe inductive declarations cannot both occur in the same `mutual` block
inductive1.lean:100:0-100:4: error: Missing resulting type for constructor `T1.z2`: Its resulting type must be specified because it is part of an inductive family declaration
inductive1.lean:105:7-105:9: error: type expected, got
  (T1 : Nat → Type)
inductive1.lean:108:7-108:10: error(lean.ctorResultingTypeMismatch): Unexpected resulting type for constructor `T1.z1`: Expected an application of

Ideally trailing whitespace should be ignored. CURRENTLY NOT WORKING as we use `Syntax.eqWithInfo`;
we will need to patch old syntax info stored in the info tree to go back to `Syntax.structRangeEq`.

Insufficient reuse checking of trailing whitespace info in the info tree led to the goal view
showing multiple tactics as they all claimed to be at the end of the file (which they were in prior
versions).

A tactic mvar may sometimes escape the term elaboration it was created from and should not break
incremental reporting in this case.

ppDeepTerms.lean:39:32-39:33: warning: The '⋯' token is used by the pretty printer to indicate omitted terms, and it should not be used directly. It logs this warning and then elaborates like '_'.

The presence of '⋯' in pretty printing output is controlled by the 'pp.maxSteps', 'pp.deepTerms' and 'pp.proofs' options. These options can be further adjusted using 'pp.deepTerms.threshold' and 'pp.proofs.threshold'. If this '⋯' was copied from the Infoview, the hover there for the original '⋯' explains which of these options led to the omission.

Error message shouldn't fake a higher-order unification. This next one used to give
```
  type mismatch
    test n2 ?_
  has type
    (fun x ↦ x * 2) (g2 n2) = n2 : Prop
  but is expected to have type
    (fun x ↦ x * 2) (g2 n2) = n2 : Prop
```
It now doesn't for the stronger reason that we don't let `addPPExplicitToExposeDiff` have side effects,
but still it avoids doing incorrect higher-order unifications in its reasoning.

Because `Array.isEqvAux` was defined by well-founded recursion, this used to fail with
```
tactic 'decide' failed for proposition
  #[0, 1] = #[0, 1]
since its 'Decidable' instance
  #[0, 1].instDecidableEq #[0, 1]
did not reduce to 'isTrue' or 'isFalse'.

After unfolding the instances 'instDecidableEqNat', 'Array.instDecidableEq' and 'Nat.decEq', reduction got stuck at the 'Decidable' instance
  match h : #[0, 1].isEqv #[0, 1] fun a b => decide (a = b) with
  | true => isTrue ⋯
  | false => isFalse ⋯
```

example : #[0, 1] = #[0, 1] := by decide

example : let a := Array.range (10^6); a == a := by native_decide

There are other `Array` functions that use well-founded recursion,
which we've marked as `@[semireducible]`. We test that `decide` can unfold them here.

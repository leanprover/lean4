Minimized from https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/25053
The issue is that `by exact k` under the binder creates a delayed assigned metavariable
```
?m : ℕ →
  let val := 22;
  val = 22 → ℕ → ℕ
```
that is applied to `val` and `val_def`. Note that this first `ℕ` corresponds to `val`,
so, despite the fact that the local context of the metavariable delayed assigned to `?m`
has `val` as a let binding, the value is still being passed in (the types are *not* ensuring
that `val` is defeq to the expected `val`!)

In this case, we can fix the issue by making sure to instantiate metavariables before running
`isTypeCorrect`.
-/
example : True := by
  let val := 22
  have val_def : val = 22 := rfl
  have : Nat.zero = (fun k => by exact k) Nat.zero := by
    clear_value val -- used to fail
    rfl
  trivial

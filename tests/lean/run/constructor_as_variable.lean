Testing for linter.constructorNameAsVariable

This linter checks warns when a bound variable's name is the name of a constructor of the variable's
type, which probably indicates a namespace mistake, but can be otherwise hard to find.

The linter is designed to interact well with the suggestions provided when a non-constructor is used
where a constructor would be expected in a pattern, so that users who don't know Lean namespaces
will be guided to the right qualified names. Thus, both are tested together here.

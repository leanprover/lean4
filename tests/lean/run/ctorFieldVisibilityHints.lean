# Visibility hints for fields and constructors

This test assess error message hints for fields and constructors with invalid visibilities where the
necessary correction is reasonably unambiguous.

error: Constructor must be `private` because one or more of this structure's fields are `private`

Hint: Mark constructor as `private`

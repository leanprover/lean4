    : f a = x →
      -- At this point `f` has not been internalized
      g f →
      -- Since `f` has now occurred as the argument of `f`, it is internalized
      f b = y →
      -- The congruence hash for `f a` must not depend on whether `f` has been internalized or not
      b = a →
      x = y := by

-- Same example with `a = b` to ensure the previous issue does not depend on how we break
-- ties when merging equivalence classes of the same size

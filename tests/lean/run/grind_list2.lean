-- Note that `grind_list.lean` uses `reset_grind_attrs%` to clear the grind attributes.
-- This file does not: it is testing the grind attributes in the library.

-- This file follows `Data/List/Lemmas.lean`. Indeed, if we decided `grind` is allowed there,
-- it should be possible to replace proofs there with these.
-- (In some cases, the proofs here are now cheating and directly using the same result from the library,
-- but initially I was avoiding this, but haven't bothered writing `grind [-X]` everywhere.)

-- This file only contains those theorems that can be proved "effortlessly" with `grind`.
-- `tests/lean/grind/experiments/list.lean` contains everything from `Data/List/Lemmas.lean`
-- that still resists `grind`!

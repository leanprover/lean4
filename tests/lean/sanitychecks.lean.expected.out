failed to infer structural recursion:
no parameters suitable for structural recursion

well-founded recursion cannot be used, 'unsound' does not take any (non-fixed) arguments
sanitychecks.lean:4:8-4:32: error: 'partial' theorems are not allowed, 'partial' is a code generation directive

sanitychecks.lean:18:12-18:20: error: invalid use of 'partial', 'Foo.unsound3' is not a function
  False
sanitychecks.lean:20:0-20:54: error: failed to compile 'partial' definition 'Foo.unsound4', could not prove that the type
  âˆ€ (x : Unit), False
is nonempty.

This process uses multiple strategies:
- It looks for a parameter that matches the return type.
- It tries synthesizing 'Inhabited' and 'Nonempty' instances for the return type, while making every parameter into a local 'Inhabited' instance.
- It tries unfolding the return type.

If the return type is defined using the 'structure' or 'inductive' command, you can try adding a 'deriving Nonempty' clause to it.

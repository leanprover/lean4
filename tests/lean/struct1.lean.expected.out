struct1.lean:9:14-9:17: error: Invalid resulting type: Expected a sort

Hint: Examples of valid sorts include `Type _`, `Sort _`, and `Prop`
struct1.lean:12:20-12:29: error: expected structure

Hint: This error is possibly due to a change in the `structure` syntax. Now the syntax is `structure S : Type extends P` rather than `structure S extends P : Type`.

The purpose of the change is to accommodate `structure S extends toP : P` syntax for naming parent projections.

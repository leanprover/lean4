termination_by.lean:62:2-62:23: error: incomplete set of `termination_by` annotations:
This function is mutually with isOdd, which does not have a `termination_by` clause.
The present clause is ignored.
Try this: termination_by x1 => x1
termination_by.lean:79:2-79:27: error: incomplete set of `termination_by` annotations:
This function is mutually with Test.f, Test.h and Test.i, which do not have a `termination_by` clause.
The present clause is ignored.
termination_by.lean:101:2-101:27: error: Invalid `termination_by`; this function is mutually recursive with Test2.f, which is marked as `termination_by structural` so this one also needs to be marked `structural`.
termination_by.lean:120:2-120:38: error: Invalid `termination_by`; this function is mutually recursive with Test3.f, which is not marked as `structural` so this one cannot be `structural` either.
termination_by.lean:144:2-144:38: error: Invalid `termination_by`; this function is mutually recursive with Test4.f, which is not marked as `structural` so this one cannot be `structural` either.
termination_by.lean:159:2-159:21: error: Invalid `decreasing_by`; this function is marked as structurally recursive, so no explicit termination proof is needed.

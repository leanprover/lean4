univInference.lean:25:48-25:54: warning: Inferred universe level for type may be unnecessarily high. The inferred resulting universe is
  Type (max u v)
but it possibly could be
  Sort (max (max 1 u) v)
Explicitly providing a resulting universe with no metavariables will silence this warning.

Note: The elaborated resulting universe after constructor elaboration is
  Type ?u
The inference algorithm attempts to compute the smallest level for `?u` such that all universe constraints for all constructor fields are satisfied, with some approximations. The following derived constraint(s) are the cause of this possible unnecessarily high universe:
  v ≤ ?u+1
  u ≤ ?u+1
For example, if the resulting universe is of the form `Sort (?r + 1)` and a constructor field is in universe `Sort u`, the constraint `u ≤ ?r + 1` leads to the unnecessarily high resulting universe `Sort (u + 1)`. Using `Sort (max 1 u)` avoids this universe bump, if using it is possible.

Hint: A possible solution is to use levels of the form `max 1 _` or `_ + 1` to ensure the universe is of the form `Type _`
